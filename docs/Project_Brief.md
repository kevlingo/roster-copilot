# Project Brief: Roster Copilot

## Introduction / Problem Statement

The vibrant world of fantasy football, while immensely engaging, presents significant hurdles for newcomers due to its steep learning curve and complex strategic nuances. Existing platforms offer a wealth of data and standard management tools, but they often leave users, both novice and experienced, to sift through extensive information and bear the full cognitive load of decision-making without truly personalized or adaptive guidance.

This creates a gap for an intelligent solution that not only demystifies fantasy football for beginners but also provides a seamless, intuitive, and deeply personalized decision-making experience for all users. Current tools may provide statistics, but they lack an integrated 'copilot' that understands individual play styles, risk tolerances, and league contexts to proactively assist managers in making optimal choices efficiently and confidently. Roster Copilot aims to fill this void by being that intelligent, always-on assistant.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** To be the indispensable AI companion that empowers fantasy football players of all levels to learn, strategize, and succeed with personalized, intelligent, and effortless guidance.
- **Primary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Implement the core "AI Copilot Onboarding Interview" to effectively capture user preferences (experience, risk tolerance, play style) and create a foundational "User Preference Profile."
  - Goal 2: Provide personalized, AI-driven assistance for key in-season decisions, including weekly waiver wire pickups and matchup-focused start/sit suggestions that consider the user's specific opponent, leveraging the User Preference Profile.
  - Goal 3: Offer a simplified and guided "Draft Day Co-Pilot" experience that helps new users understand the draft process and make informed player selections based on their learned preferences and basic roster construction needs.
  - Goal 4: Ensure a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-navigate user interface that allows users to easily access core fantasy management functions and AI Copilot insights.
- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
  - Demonstrable user interest and value perception, indicated by a steady growth in sign-ups and a high completion rate (>70-80%) for the AI Copilot Onboarding Interview
  - Strong engagement with core AI Copilot features (waiver/start-sit advice, Draft Day Co-Pilot), with users frequently interacting with and accepting/rating suggestions positively
  - Positive qualitative feedback from early users highlighting the AI Copilot's helpfulness, ease of use, and its unique, personalized approach
  - Evidence that Roster Copilot significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new fantasy football players, as indicated by their feedback on confidence levels and successful season navigation
  - Healthy user retention throughout a fantasy season, suggesting ongoing value delivery

## Target Audience / Users

Roster Copilot is designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of fantasy football enthusiasts, with specific value propositions for both newcomers and experienced players:

* **Newcomers to Fantasy Football:** This is a primary target audience. Roster Copilot aims to significantly lower the barrier to entry by providing a guided onboarding experience, offering clear explanations for core game mechanics, and building confidence through personalized AI insights.
* **Seasoned/Experienced Fantasy Players:** Roster Copilot offers these users a distinct strategic advantage and a more efficient way to manage their teams by providing deeply personalized insights, sophisticated simulation capabilities (as post-MVP features), time-saving automation, and new levels of strategic depth.

This dual approach ensures Roster Copilot is an indispensable tool for anyone looking to learn, enjoy, and succeed in fantasy football, regardless of their prior experience.

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- **Constraints:**
  - Primary Nature: This project is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) specifically for a hackathon entry
  - Timeline: The core application MVP must be developed within a one-month timeframe
  - Development Methodology: Heavy reliance on AI tools and assistance is planned to achieve this rapid development
  - Budget: Assumed to be very lean, typical for a hackathon (focus on core functionality, marketing site is secondary)
  - Scope: Must be tightly controlled to be achievable within one month as a PoC
- **Initial Architectural Preferences (if any):**
  - Platform: For a one-month PoC, a web-based application is likely the most feasible approach
  - Technology Choices: Lean towards technologies known for rapid development, strong AI library support, and ease of deployment
- **Risks:**
  - The extremely tight one-month timeline for delivering a functional PoC with novel AI features
  - Scope Creep during development
  - AI Development Efficiency: The actual time to generate, integrate, test, and debug AI-generated code can be unpredictable
  - Data Requirements: Sourcing, integrating, and processing NFL data within the month
  - PoC Limitations: The output will be a Proof of Concept and will need clear expectation management for hackathon demonstration
- **User Preferences:**
  - The app must clearly and effectively demonstrate the core unique AI Copilot capabilities outlined for the MVP
  - It should be functional enough for a compelling demonstration of these core AI features
  - Aesthetics & User Experience: The application must possess a modern, clean, and visually appealing user interface that "pops." It should also be responsive
  - Overall, speed of development and ease of showcasing the AI's unique value are primary drivers, balanced with a compelling and intuitive UI for the core demo path

## Relevant Research (Optional)

Initial market exploration was conducted to understand the existing fantasy football application landscape. Key findings include:

* **Major Platforms Identified:** Prominent platforms such as ESPN Fantasy Sports, Yahoo Fantasy Football, Sleeper, and NFL Fantasy Football were reviewed, among others.
* **Common Core Features:** A standard set of features is common across most platforms, including comprehensive league creation and customization, various draft formats, robust team management tools, live scoring, player statistics, news integration, and mobile app availability.
* **Current AI Application Landscape:** While sophisticated algorithms and data analytics are widely used for player projections, rankings, and decision-support tools (e.g., by ESPN leveraging IBM Watson, and specialized advice sites like Draft Sharks and FantasyPros), explicitly marketed, deeply personalized, and continuously learning "AI Copilot" functionalities as envisioned for Roster Copilot are not a dominant feature in mainstream league hosting platforms. This presents a significant opportunity for differentiation by offering a truly intelligent, adaptive, and user-centric assistant.

This research underpins the strategy for Roster Copilot to provide both essential core functionalities and innovative, AI-driven copilotship to carve out a unique position in the market.
