# Story 5.2: Implement Chat Message Bubbles Component

## Status: Accepted

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see my messages and AI responses displayed as distinct chat bubbles
- so that I can easily follow the conversation history.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** A `ChatMessageBubble.tsx` component is created to render individual chat messages.
2.  **AC2:** User messages are displayed in light grey bubbles (e.g., `#E5E7EB` or Tailwind `bg-gray-200`) with rounded corners and minimal shadow, as per UI Spec section 2.3 & 2.4.2.
3.  **AC3:** AI messages are displayed in light blue bubbles (e.g., `#A0D2DB` or Tailwind `bg-blue-200`) with rounded corners and minimal shadow, as per UI Spec section 2.3 & 2.4.2.
4.  **AC4:** Text within user bubbles is aligned appropriately (e.g., left).
5.  **AC5:** Text within AI bubbles is aligned appropriately (e.g., right, or opposite to user bubbles).
6.  **AC6:** Bubbles contain the message text. Timestamps are optional and subtle if included (UI Spec 2.4.2).
7.  **AC7:** Bubbles have adequate internal padding and margins between them.
8.  **AC8:** Text color provides sufficient contrast for readability (e.g., `#1F2937` or Tailwind `text-gray-800`).
9.  **AC9:** Typography (font family, size, line height) aligns with UI Spec section 2.6.
10. **AC10:** Links within chat messages are clickable.
11. **AC11:** Text selection within bubbles is possible.
12. **AC12:** The component is keyboard accessible as per WCAG 2.1 AA+ (UI Spec section 2.7).

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   Refer to UI/UX Design Spec section 2.4.2 (`ChatMessageBubble`), section 2.3 (Visual Design), and 2.6 (Typography) in [`docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md`](docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md).
-   Component path: `src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.tsx` as per Frontend Architecture Plan (section 3.1).
-   This component will be used by `ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx`.
-   Use Tailwind CSS for styling, leveraging colors and styles defined in UI Spec.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- The `ChatMessageBubble` component implements distinct styling for user and AI messages, including background color, bubble alignment, rounded corners, and shadow, as per UI specifications.
- Timestamps are displayed subtly below the message text, formatted to a user-friendly time string.
- Message text is rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to fulfill AC10 (clickable links). **Important Security Note:** This approach assumes that the HTML content provided in `message.text` is pre-sanitized and trusted. If the content source is not guaranteed to be safe (e.g., direct user input without sanitization upstream), this presents an XSS vulnerability. This should be reviewed and addressed in the data pipeline that populates `MessageObject`, or an alternative like a markdown-to-HTML converter with sanitization, or a link-finding library should be used if message.text is plain.
- Text selection within bubbles is possible due to standard browser behavior for paragraph elements.
- Basic accessibility considerations such as color contrast and text sizing have been addressed. Keyboard accessibility for links is standard for `<a>` tags. ARIA roles for the overall chat log structure (e.g., `role="log"`) are expected to be managed by the parent component (`ChatBubbleOverlay`) that will consume these individual bubbles.
- Unit tests have been implemented to cover rendering for different sender types (user/AI), message content (plain text and HTML with links), and timestamp display.

### Change Log
- **NEW:** Created [`src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.tsx`](src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.tsx) - Implemented the chat message bubble component.
- **NEW:** Created [`src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.test.tsx`](src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.test.tsx) - Added unit tests for the ChatMessageBubble component.
- **MODIFIED:** Updated this story file ([`docs/stories/5.2.story.md`](docs/stories/5.2.story.md)) with task progress, completion notes, and DoD checklist report.

### Story DoD Checklist Report

1.  **Requirements Met:**
    - [x] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented. (Component created, displays user/AI messages distinctly)
    - [x] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met. (Verified AC1-12 through implementation and checks)

2.  **Coding Standards & Project Structure:**
    - [x] All new/modified code strictly adheres to `Operational Guidelines`. (Followed standard React/TypeScript/Tailwind best practices)
    - [x] All new/modified code aligns with `Project Structure` (file locations, naming, etc.). (`src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.tsx` and `src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.test.tsx` as per Frontend Architecture Plan section 3.1 and 3.6)
    - [x] Adherence to `Tech Stack` for technologies/versions used (if story introduces or modifies tech usage). (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS used as per stack)
    - [N/A] Adherence to `Api Reference` and `Data Models` (if story involves API or data model changes). (No API/data model changes in this component story)
    - [x] Basic security best practices (e.g., input validation, proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets) applied for new/modified code. (Note on `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` added above and in component comments, assuming input is sanitized upstream)
    - [x] No new linter errors or warnings introduced **in the modified files**. (One lint issue was found and fixed in `ChatMessageBubble.tsx`. Other project lint issues are pre-existing.)

3.  **Testing:**
    - [x] All required unit tests as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
    - [N/A] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented. (Integration tests for this component would be part of `ChatBubbleOverlay` or `PersistentChatInterface` stories)
    - [x] All tests (unit, integration, E2E if applicable) pass successfully. (Unit tests for `ChatMessageBubble` pass)
    - [N/A] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined). (No specific coverage standard mentioned for this story, but core functionalities like sender differentiation, HTML content, and timestamp rendering are tested)

4.  **Functionality & Verification:**
    - [N/A] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (e.g., running the app locally, checking UI, testing API endpoints). (Cannot perform manual UI verification as an agent. Component is ready for integration and visual verification in a development environment.)
