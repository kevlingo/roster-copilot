# Story 5.4: Implement Hide Chat Button Component

## Status: Accepted

## Story

- As a user
- I want a control to hide the chat bubble overlay
- so that I can have an unobstructed view of the page content when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** A `HideChatButton.tsx` component is created.
2.  **AC2:** The component renders a standard 'X' (close) icon, as per UI Spec section 2.4.3 and 2.5.
3.  **AC3:** The button is positioned within the `ChatInput` component area, to the right of the 'Send' button, as per UI Spec sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.3.
4.  **AC4:** The button is sufficiently large for easy tapping/clicking and has contrasting color for visibility against the `ChatInput` background.
5.  **AC5:** Clicking/tapping the button triggers a handler (passed from `ChatInput`, originating in `PersistentChatInterface`) to hide the `ChatBubbleOverlay`.
6.  **AC6:** The button handles default and hover/focus states.
7.  **AC7:** The button is keyboard accessible and has clear focus indicators (UI Spec 2.7).
8.  **AC8:** An `aria-label` is provided for the icon-only button (UI Spec 2.7).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1:** Create the `HideChatButton.tsx` component structure. (AC: 1)
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement props for an `onClick` handler.
- [x] **Task 2:** Implement button appearance and icon. (AC: 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Render an 'X' icon using a suitable icon library (Material Icons, Heroicons, or Feather Icons).
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Style the button for size, position, and contrast using Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **Task 3:** Implement interaction logic. (AC: 5)
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Connect the `onClick` prop to the handler in `PersistentChatInterface` that toggles overlay visibility.
- [x] **Task 4:** Implement button states (default, hover/focus). (AC: 6)
- [x] **Task 5:** Ensure accessibility. (AC: 7, 8)
    - [x] Subtask 5.1: Ensure keyboard operability and focus indicators.
    - [x] Subtask 5.2: Add `aria-label="Hide chat messages"`.
- [x] **Task 6:** Write unit tests for `HideChatButton` component.

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   Refer to UI/UX Design Spec section 2.4.3 (`HideChatButton`) and 2.5 (Iconography) in [`docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md`](docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md).
-   Component path: `src/components/ai-chat/buttons/HideChatButton.tsx` as per Frontend Architecture Plan (section 3.1).
-   Receives an `onClick` handler from its parent component, `ChatInput.tsx` (which in turn gets it from `PersistentChatInterface.tsx`).
*   Icons: Project uses `lucide-react` (a fork of Feather Icons, which is an approved style). Will use `X` icon from `lucide-react` to avoid adding a new dependency.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- **Updated 2025-06-03:** This story has been updated to reflect a design change where the `HideChatButton` is now a child of the `ChatInput` component, rather than `ChatBubbleOverlay`. The ACs and guidance have been adjusted accordingly.
- Used `lucide-react` for the 'X' icon as it's an existing project dependency, instead of adding `@heroicons/react`. This aligns with UI spec's allowance for Feather Icons (Lucide is a fork).
- Test for keyboard activation was updated to use `@testing-library/user-event` for more robust simulation, resolving initial test failures with `fireEvent`.

### Change Log

- **`src/components/ai-chat/buttons/HideChatButton.tsx`**: Created new component.
- **`src/components/ai-chat/buttons/HideChatButton.test.tsx`**: Created unit tests for `HideChatButton`.
- **`src/components/ai-chat/ChatInput.tsx`**: Imported and integrated `HideChatButton` (reflecting design change).
- **`docs/stories/5.4.story.md`**: Updated tasks, notes, and DoD checklist to reflect new integration point (2025-06-03).
