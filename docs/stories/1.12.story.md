# Story 1.12: Display of Fantasy Scores

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to view fantasy scores for NFL games (from the PoC static dataset) so that I can track player performances and my team's matchup.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The application can access and display NFL game information and player fantasy scores derived from the static PoC dataset (`NFLGame` for game details/outcomes, `NFLPlayer` for `projectedPoints` or simulated actual scores for a given week).
2.  Users can view a summary of real NFL game scores for the current/past PoC week's games relevant to their league. This could be a "Scoreboard" component on the League Home/Dashboard (`app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`) or a dedicated "Scores" page (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/scores/page.tsx`).
3.  For each real NFL game displayed, users see participating teams (`NFLGame.homeTeamAbbreviation`, `NFLGame.awayTeamAbbreviation`), their real scores (`NFLGame.homeScore`, `NFLGame.awayScore`), and game status (`NFLGame.gameStatus`).
4.  Within a user's weekly fantasy matchup view (UI component/page, potentially `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/matchup/page.tsx` or part of the dashboard):
    * The fantasy points for each player in their starting lineup are displayed.
    * The fantasy points for each player in their opponent's starting lineup are displayed.
    * Total fantasy scores for both the user's team and opponent's team for the week are displayed.
    * These points are based on `NFLPlayer.projectedPoints` (or simulated actual scores if that field evolves) from the static PoC dataset for the relevant `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek`.
5.  For PoC, displaying a single, static set of points for the week (based on `projectedPoints`) is acceptable. Simulating live scoring updates is out of scope for MVP.
6.  The UI clearly indicates that displayed scores are based on PoC static/projected data.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - API Endpoint for Weekly Scores & Matchups (`GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/matchups?week=[weekNumber]`)**
    - [x] Create API Route Handler.
    - [x] Endpoint should be protected and use `leagueId`, `weekNumber`, and authenticated `userId`.
    - [x] Logic to determine the user's fantasy matchup for the given week (who their opponent `FantasyTeam_PoC` is). This might require a predefined league schedule logic.
    - [x] Retrieve relevant `NFLGame` data for all NFL games in the specified week.
    - [x] Retrieve lineup data (starters) for both the user's team and their opponent's team for that week (from Story 1.10 data).
    - [x] For every player in both starting lineups, fetch their `NFLPlayer` data (especially `projectedPoints` or simulated actual scores for that week).
    - [x] Calculate total fantasy scores for both teams in the matchup.
    - [x] Return data structure including: list of all NFL games with their scores/status, and specific matchup details (user's team, opponent's team, players in each lineup with their fantasy scores, total team scores).
    - [x] Apply core API middleware.
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - "NFL Scoreboard" UI Component**
    - [x] **Subtask 2.1:** Prompt v0.io (or similar) to generate a UI component that displays a list of NFL games for a week, showing home team, away team, scores, and game status.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.2:** Review, adapt generated code, ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.3:** Integrate this component into the League Dashboard (`app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`) or a dedicated Scores page, populating it with data from the backend API.
- [x] **Task 3: Frontend - "Fantasy Matchup" UI Component**
    - [x] **Subtask 3.1:** Prompt v0.io (or similar) to generate a UI component that displays a head-to-head fantasy matchup. It should show two fantasy teams, lists of their starting players with individual fantasy scores, and total team fantasy scores.
    - [x] **Subtask 3.2:** Review, adapt generated code, ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 3.3:** Integrate this component (e.g., on the League Dashboard or a dedicated Matchup page `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/matchup/page.tsx`), populating it with data from the backend API for the user's current weekly matchup.
- [x] **Task 4: Frontend - Page Integration and Data Fetching**
    - [x] Implement logic on relevant pages (Dashboard, Scores, Matchup) to fetch data from the `/api/leagues/[leagueId]/matchups` endpoint.
    - [x] Pass data to the Scoreboard and Fantasy Matchup components.
    - [x] Handle loading states and errors.

    - [x] Unit tests for frontend Scoreboard and Fantasy Matchup components (display logic).
    - [x] Integration test for the `matchups` API endpoint.
    - [x] E2E test for viewing the NFL scoreboard and the user's fantasy matchup with correct player scores and team totals displayed.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Sports Data Visualization & Real-Time Scoring (2025 Best Practices)**
- **Advanced Visualization Libraries**: Implement high-performance sports data visualization with modern React libraries:
  ```typescript
  interface FantasyMatchupData {
    week: number;
    homeTeam: FantasyTeam;
    awayTeam: FantasyTeam;
    gameStatus: 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
    lastUpdated: Date;
    liveEvents: MatchupEvent[];
  }

  interface MatchupEvent {
    timestamp: Date;
    playerId: string;
    eventType: 'touchdown' | 'field_goal' | 'interception' | 'fumble';
    fantasyPoints: number;
    description: string;
  }

  const LiveScoreboard: React.FC<{ matchupData: FantasyMatchupData }> = ({ matchupData }) => {
    const [liveScores, setLiveScores] = useState<ScoreUpdate[]>([]);

    // WebSocket integration for real-time updates
    useEffect(() => {
      const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://api.fantasy.com/live/${matchupData.week}`);

      ws.onmessage = (event) => {
        const scoreUpdate: ScoreUpdate = JSON.parse(event.data);
        setLiveScores(prev => [...prev, scoreUpdate]);

        // Trigger smooth animation for score changes
        animateScoreChange(scoreUpdate.playerId, scoreUpdate.fantasyPoints);
      };

      return () => ws.close();
    }, [matchupData.week]);

    return (
      <div className="live-scoreboard">
        <XYChart
          theme={customSportsTheme}
          xScale={{ type: 'time' }}
          yScale={{ type: 'linear' }}
          width={800}
          height={400}
        >
          <LineSeries
            data={liveScores}
            dataKey="fantasyPoints"
            stroke="#00ff00"
            strokeWidth={2}
          />
          <Axis orientation="bottom" label="Game Time" />
          <Axis orientation="left" label="Fantasy Points" />
        </XYChart>
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-100ms global latency with edge computing and efficient data structures
- **Real-Time Data Pipelines**: WebSocket integration with delta updates for minimal payload size
- **GPU Acceleration**: CSS transforms for smooth score animations and transitions

### **Head-to-Head Comparison Interfaces & Performance Metrics**
- **TypeScript Interface Design**: Optimize for performance-critical sports analytics with proper interface caching:
  ```typescript
  interface PlayerPerformance {
    playerId: string;
    weeklyStats: WeeklyStats[];
    seasonTotals: SeasonStats;
    projectedPoints: number;
    actualPoints?: number;
    efficiency: PerformanceMetrics;
  }

  interface WeeklyStats {
    week: number;
    opponent: string;
    fantasyPoints: number;
    gameScript: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral';
    usage: {
      targets?: number;
      carries?: number;
      snapCount: number;
      redZoneOpportunities: number;
    };
  }

  interface PerformanceMetrics {
    consistencyRating: number; // 0-100
    ceilingScore: number;
    floorScore: number;
    volatilityIndex: number;
    trendDirection: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  }

  const MatchupComparison: React.FC<{
    homeTeam: FantasyTeam;
    awayTeam: FantasyTeam
  }> = ({ homeTeam, awayTeam }) => {
    const comparisonMetrics = useMemo(() =>
      calculateMatchupAdvantage(homeTeam, awayTeam),
      [homeTeam, awayTeam]
    );

    return (
      <div className="matchup-comparison">
        <div className="team-comparison">
          {['QB', 'RB', 'WR', 'TE', 'K', 'DEF'].map(position => (
            <PositionComparison
              key={position}
              position={position}
              homePlayer={homeTeam.starters[position]}
              awayPlayer={awayTeam.starters[position]}
              advantage={comparisonMetrics[position]}
            />
          ))}
        </div>

        <div className="projected-outcome">
          <WinProbabilityMeter
            homeWinProb={comparisonMetrics.homeWinProbability}
            projectedSpread={comparisonMetrics.projectedSpread}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

            showProjection={true}
            showTrend={true}
          />
        )
      },
      {
        accessorKey: 'projectedPoints',
        header: 'Proj. Points',
        cell: ({ getValue }) => (
          <PointsDisplay
            points={getValue() as number}
            animated={true}
          />
        )
      },
      {
        accessorKey: 'efficiency.consistencyRating',
        header: 'Consistency',
        cell: ({ getValue }) => (
          <ConsistencyMeter rating={getValue() as number} />
        )
      }
    ], []);

    return (
      <DataTable
        data={players}
        columns={columns}
        enableVirtualization={true}
        enableSorting={true}

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy (2025 Best Practices)

### **Testing Architecture for Matchup Display**

**Purpose**: Provide research-backed testing patterns for head-to-head comparisons, statistical analysis, responsive layouts, and real-time score updates to prevent coding agents from common matchup testing loops.

#### **Head-to-Head Comparison Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Complex matchup calculations and projections
test('calculates head-to-head matchup projections accurately', () => {
  const team1 = { id: 'team1', avgScore: 125.5, players: mockPlayers1 };
  const team2 = { id: 'team2', avgScore: 118.3, players: mockPlayers2 };

  const matchup = calculateMatchupProjection(team1, team2, 12);

  expect(matchup.projectedWinner).toBe('team1');
  expect(matchup.winProbability).toBeCloseTo(0.65, 2);
  expect(matchup.projectedScores.team1).toBeCloseTo(125.5, 1);
});

test('handles live score updates during matchup', async () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useMatchupData('matchup123'));

  act(() => {
    mockWebSocket.simulateMessage({
      type: 'PLAYER_SCORE_UPDATE',
      playerId: 'player456',
      newScore: 15.6,
      matchupId: 'matchup123'
    });
  });

  await waitFor(() => {
    const updatedMatchup = result.current.matchup;
    expect(updatedMatchup.team1.currentScore).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

#### **Responsive Design & Performance Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Matchup display performance and layout adaptation
test('renders matchup efficiently on mobile devices', () => {
  global.innerWidth = 375;
  render(<MatchupDisplay matchupId="matchup123" />);

  expect(screen.getByTestId('mobile-matchup-layout')).toBeVisible();
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('desktop-matchup-layout')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('loads matchup data within performance budget', async () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  render(<MatchupDisplay matchupId="complex-matchup" />);

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('matchup-scores')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  const loadTime = performance.now() - start;
  expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(200); // <200ms load time
});
```

#### **End-to-End Matchup Flow**
```typescript
// Playwright E2E testing
test('complete matchup viewing experience', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/league/league123/matchup/week12/team1-vs-team2');

  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="team1-score"]')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="team2-score"]')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="player-performances"]')).toBeVisible();

  // Test real-time updates
  await page.waitForFunction(() => {
    const score = document.querySelector('[data-testid="team1-score"]')?.textContent;
    return score && parseFloat(score) > 0;
  });
});
```

**Key Testing Patterns:**
- **Statistical Calculations**: Test projection algorithms and win probability calculations
- **Real-Time Updates**: Verify WebSocket integration for live score updates
- **Responsive Layouts**: Test mobile and desktop layout adaptations
- **Performance**: Benchmark data loading and rendering times
