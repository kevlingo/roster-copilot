# Story 2.5: Gemini API Conversational Intelligence Foundation

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user undergoing AI Copilot onboarding, I want to interact with an AI-powered conversational system that uses Gemini API to provide dynamic, personality-driven responses so that my onboarding experience feels like chatting with a knowledgeable fantasy football enthusiast rather than following a scripted conversation.

## Dependencies

- **Replaces:** Current keyword-matching conversation system (Story 2.1 implementation)
- **Foundation for:** Story 2.6 (AI-Powered Archetype Discovery) and Story 2.7 (Enhanced Questionnaire)

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Gemini API Integration**: The system integrates with Google's Gemini API to power all conversational responses, replacing the existing `CONVERSATION_SCRIPTS` and keyword-matching logic.

2. **Jake's Personality System**: The AI embodies "Jake" persona with consistent personality traits:
   - Enthusiastic fantasy football expert
   - Knowledgeable but not condescending
   - Adapts communication style to match user energy and expertise level
   - Uses fantasy football terminology naturally
   - Shows genuine excitement about helping users succeed

3. **Dynamic Response Generation**: All AI responses are generated dynamically based on:
   - Full conversation context and history
   - User's communication style and tone
   - User's apparent expertise level
   - Previous exchanges in the conversation
   - Current conversation phase and goals

4. **System Prompt Architecture**: Implement comprehensive system prompt that defines:
   - Jake's personality and communication style
   - Onboarding mission and goals
   - Response guidelines and conversation intelligence
   - Fantasy football knowledge and enthusiasm
   - Error handling and conversation repair strategies

5. **Conversation Context Management**: The system maintains full conversation context:
   - Sends complete conversation history to Gemini API
   - Tracks conversation state and current phase
   - Preserves user preferences and selections
   - Enables natural references to previous exchanges

6. **Intelligent Conversation Flow**: Replace rigid phase-based flow with intelligent conversation management:
   - Natural conversation progression without forced steps
   - Ability to handle tangents and follow-up questions
   - Graceful conversation repair for misunderstandings
   - Flexible paths to achieve onboarding goals

7. **API Error Handling**: Robust error handling for Gemini API integration:
   - Graceful fallbacks for API failures
   - User-friendly error messages that maintain Jake's personality
   - Retry logic for temporary failures
   - Fallback to basic responses if needed

8. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient API usage and response handling:
   - Reasonable response times (2-4 seconds for natural feel)
   - Proper rate limiting and API quota management
   - Conversation context optimization for API efficiency
   - Caching strategies where appropriate

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Gemini API Integration (Latest 2025 Best Practices):**
  - Use `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05` model for enhanced conversation capabilities
  - Implement TypeScript interfaces for strict type checking on API configurations
  - Enable multi-tool usage with code execution and URL context tools for enhanced responses
  - Use streaming responses with proper error handling for optimal user experience
  - Reference: [Google Gemini API Latest Updates](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini)

- **System Prompt Strategy (2025 Personality System Best Practices):**
  - Implement brand-aligned persona blueprints with consistent personality traits
  - Use structured prompt engineering: Primary objective, constraints, response format
  - Include contextual memory architecture for session-aware dialogue states
  - Deploy automated testing frameworks for personality consistency validation
  - Reference: [Conversational AI Personality Systems](https://respond.io/blog/conversational-ai-best-practices/)

- **Conversation Management:**
