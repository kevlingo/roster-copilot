# Story 1.1: User Account Creation with Email Verification

## Status: InProgress

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a new user, I want to be able to sign up for a Roster Copilot account **and verify my email address** so that I can securely access the platform and its features.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  User can navigate to a Sign-Up page/form (e.g., `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`).
2.  Sign-Up form requires at least a username, email address, and password.
3.  Password input has a confirmation field.
4.  System validates that the username is unique.
5.  System validates that the email address is in a valid format and is unique.
6.  System enforces password complexity rules (e.g., min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character - specific rules documented in `docs/operational-guidelines.md`).
7.  Upon submitting valid sign-up details, a new user account is created in the system with an "unverified" status (persisted in the `UserProfile` data model, `emailVerified` field should be `false`).
8.  A unique, time-limited verification link/token is generated and associated with the user's account (e.g., stored in `EmailVerificationTokens_PoC` table as per `Architecture.md#EmailVerificationToken_PoC`).
9.  The system uses the "Resend" service (as defined in `Architecture.md#Resend-API`) to send a verification email to the user's provided email address.
10. The user is informed on-screen that a verification email has been sent and they need to check their email to complete registration.
11. The verification email clearly explains its purpose and contains the verification link/token.
12. Clicking the verification link in the email (which triggers an API endpoint like `/api/auth/verify-email/[token]`) verifies the user's email address.
13. Upon successful verification:
    * The user's account status is updated to "verified" (e.g., `UserProfile.emailVerified` is set to `true`).
    * The verification token (from `EmailVerificationTokens_PoC`) is marked as used or invalidated.
14. Upon successful email verification, the user is logged in (or redirected to the login page with a success message).
15. User receives a clear success message on-screen upon completing email verification.
16. If sign-up form submission fails (e.g., username taken, invalid email format, password mismatch), clear and specific error messages are displayed to the user.
17. If the verification link is invalid (e.g., token not found, expired, or already used), an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
18. Users are blocked from accessing features requiring a verified account (e.g., joining leagues, drafting) until their email is verified.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Sign-Up API Endpoint (`/api/auth/signup`)**
    - [x] Create API Route Handler at `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`.
    - [x] Implement input DTO validation (username, email, password, passwordConfirmation) using `class-validator` or similar as per `Architecture.md` security best practices.
    - [x] Implement logic to check for username uniqueness against `UserProfile` table.
    - [x] Implement logic to check for email uniqueness against `UserProfile` table.
    - [x] Implement password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
    - [x] Create `UserProfile` record with `emailVerified: false`.
    - [x] Generate unique verification token (secure, time-limited) and store in `EmailVerificationTokens_PoC` table with expiry.
    - [x] Integrate with Notification Service (Resend) to send verification email containing the token/link.
    - [x] Apply core API middleware (error handling, logging from Story 1.0.3).
- [x] **Task 2: Backend - Email Verification API Endpoint (`/api/auth/verify-email/[token]`)**
    - [x] Create API Route Handler at `app/api/auth/verify-email/[token]/route.ts`.
    - [x] Implement logic to validate the token from URL parameter (exists in `EmailVerificationTokens_PoC`, not expired, not used).
    - [x] If valid, update `UserProfile.emailVerified` to `true` for the associated user.
    - [x] Invalidate the token (mark as used or delete).
    - [x] Handle session creation/login for the user (TBD based on auth flow, could redirect to login).
    - [x] Apply core API middleware.
- [x] **Task 3: Frontend - Sign-Up Page UI & Logic (`app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`)**
    - [x] **Subtask 3.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (section related to `/signup` page: "UI: Form with fields for username, email, password, confirm password. 'Sign Up' button.") to generate initial UI structure for the Sign-Up page. (Adapted existing page based on this intent).
    - [x] **Subtask 3.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md` (directory, naming, Tailwind/DaisyUI, AX). (Adapted existing page).
    - [x] **Subtask 3.3:** Implement client-side form state management (e.g., `useState` or `react-hook-form`). (Used `react-hook-form`).
    - [x] **Subtask 3.4:** Implement client-side validation for form fields (mirroring backend where appropriate).
    - [x] **Subtask 3.5:** Implement API call to the Sign-Up endpoint on form submission using `fetch` wrapper from `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 3.6:** Handle and display success (e.g., "Verification email sent...") or error messages from the API.
- [x] **Task 4: Frontend - Email Verification Handling**
    - [x] Determine how the frontend handles the verification link click. (Backend redirects to login page with query params; login page displays message).
    - [x] Implement UI to display success message after verification and guide user to login. (Handled in login page based on query params).
- [x] **Task 5: Email Template**
    - [x] Design and implement (or configure in Resend) the HTML email template for the verification link. Ensure it's clear and professional.
- [ ] **Task 6: Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for backend validation logic, token generation, email service interaction.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for frontend form component (validation, submission logic).
    - [ ] Write integration tests for `signup` and `verify-email` API endpoints.
    - [ ] Write E2E test for the complete user registration and email verification flow using Playwright.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile`, `EmailVerificationToken_PoC` data models, and `Resend API` usage.
    - Use a strong hashing algorithm for passwords (e.g., bcrypt).
    - Verification tokens must be cryptographically secure, unique, and have a defined, reasonably short expiry time (e.g., 1-24 hours).
    - Ensure uniqueness checks for username and email are case-insensitive if appropriate.
- **Frontend:**
    - Use the v0.io prompt as a starting point for the `/signup` page UI structure. The Developer Agent will need to refine and integrate this.
    - Adhere to `Frontend-Architecture.md` for state management, API calls, and component structure.
    - Ensure error messages are user-friendly.
- **General:**
    - All API endpoints must be protected by the core API middleware (error handling, logging) established in Story 1.0.3.
