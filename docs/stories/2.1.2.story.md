# Story 2.1.2: Chat History Persistence System

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a user, I want all my chat conversations to be persistently stored so that I can continue conversations across devices and the AI can learn from our interaction history to provide personalized guidance.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Story 2.1 (Core Conversational Archetype Selection) must be completed
- **Integration:** Provides persistence foundation for all conversational features

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. All chat conversations are persistently stored in the backend, including onboarding conversations
2. When users click the "clear" button in the chat interface, only the visible UI history is cleared - backend storage remains intact
3. Chat history is preserved across device switches, allowing users to continue conversations seamlessly
4. New users default to "Eager Learner" archetype if they abandon onboarding, ensuring the app remains functional
5. When users return after abandoning onboarding, the AI gently nudges them to complete the process without being pushy
6. If users choose not to complete onboarding and engage with other features, the AI remembers this preference and doesn't repeatedly ask
7. The chat history serves as the foundation for AI personality adaptation and preference learning
8. Chat history includes conversation context, user selections, and interaction patterns for future personalization
9. The system handles chat history retrieval efficiently without impacting chat interface performance

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Design efficient chat history schema with user relationships
    - Implement robust API endpoints for chat CRUD operations
    - Consider chat history retention policies and data management
- **Frontend:**
    - Integrate persistence with existing chat interface without performance impact
    - Implement smart loading strategies for chat history
    - Handle offline scenarios and sync when connection restored
- **Database:**
    - Optimize for frequent read/write operations
    - Consider indexing strategies for efficient user chat retrieval
    - Plan for scalability as chat history grows
- **Integration:** Foundation for all future conversational features and AI personalization
