# Story 2.1.4: Enhanced Interactive Onboarding Experience

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user undergoing AI Copilot onboarding, I want an enhanced interactive experience with markdown-rendered messages, personalized welcome from "Jake" the AI agent, and visual archetype selection using interactive components so that the onboarding feels more engaging and professional.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Story 2.1 (Core Conversational Archetype Selection) must be completed
- **Enhancement:** Builds upon existing conversational foundation with UI/UX improvements

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Personalized Welcome Enhancement**: When onboarding begins, the AI introduces itself as "Jake" and uses the user's name from their profile in the greeting (e.g., "Hi [UserName]! I'm Jake, your AI Copilot...")
2. **Markdown Rendering Support**: The chat interface renders markdown formatting in AI messages, including bold text, lists, and other basic markdown elements
3. **Component Container Capability**: The chat message system supports rendering React components within messages, not just text content
4. **Interactive Archetype Selection**: When presenting archetypes, Jake displays the existing `ArchetypeCard.tsx` components in an interactive grid instead of text descriptions
5. **Visual Archetype Interaction**: Users can click directly on archetype cards to make their selection, with visual feedback (selection state, hover effects)
6. **Seamless Integration**: The enhanced interface maintains all existing functionality from Story 2.1 (natural language processing, error handling, API persistence)
7. **Responsive Design**: The interactive archetype selection works properly on both desktop and mobile devices
8. **Graceful Fallback**: If component rendering fails, the system falls back to the original text-based conversation flow
9. **Conversation Continuity**: After archetype selection via components, the conversation continues naturally with Jake's personalized confirmation
10. **Performance Optimization**: The enhanced interface maintains smooth performance without impacting chat responsiveness
