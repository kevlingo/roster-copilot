# Story 2.1.4: Enhanced Interactive Onboarding Experience

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user undergoing AI Copilot onboarding, I want an enhanced interactive experience with markdown-rendered messages, personalized welcome from "Jake" the AI agent, and visual archetype selection using interactive components so that the onboarding feels more engaging and professional.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Story 2.1 (Core Conversational Archetype Selection) must be completed
- **Enhancement:** Builds upon existing conversational foundation with UI/UX improvements

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Personalized Welcome Enhancement**: When onboarding begins, the AI introduces itself as "Jake" and uses the user's name from their profile in the greeting (e.g., "Hi [UserName]! I'm Jake, your AI Copilot...")
2. **Markdown Rendering Support**: The chat interface renders markdown formatting in AI messages, including bold text, lists, and other basic markdown elements
3. **Component Container Capability**: The chat message system supports rendering React components within messages, not just text content
4. **Interactive Archetype Selection**: When presenting archetypes, Jake displays the existing `ArchetypeCard.tsx` components in an interactive grid instead of text descriptions
5. **Visual Archetype Interaction**: Users can click directly on archetype cards to make their selection, with visual feedback (selection state, hover effects)
6. **Seamless Integration**: The enhanced interface maintains all existing functionality from Story 2.1 (natural language processing, error handling, API persistence)
7. **Responsive Design**: The interactive archetype selection works properly on both desktop and mobile devices
8. **Graceful Fallback**: If component rendering fails, the system falls back to the original text-based conversation flow
9. **Conversation Continuity**: After archetype selection via components, the conversation continues naturally with Jake's personalized confirmation
10. **Performance Optimization**: The enhanced interface maintains smooth performance without impacting chat responsiveness

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - Use `react-markdown` or similar library for markdown rendering in chat messages
    - Leverage existing `ArchetypeCard.tsx` components without modification
    - Implement component message system that can render any React component within chat
    - Maintain existing conversation state management and API integration
- **Component Integration:**
    - Create a flexible system for embedding React components in chat messages
    - Use existing archetype data structures and icons from the codebase
    - Ensure component interactions properly communicate with conversation manager
- **User Experience:**
    - Keep Jake's personality friendly and helpful, consistent with existing conversation tone
    - Ensure smooth transitions between component interactions and text conversation
    - Maintain accessibility standards for interactive elements
- **Performance:**
    - Lazy load markdown rendering library if needed
    - Optimize component rendering to avoid chat interface lag
    - Consider virtualization for large conversation histories with components
- **Integration:** Seamless enhancement of Story 2.1 foundation without breaking existing functionality
