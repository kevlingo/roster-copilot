# Story 4.2: On-Demand AI Queries for Digest Details

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 4 - AI-Driven In-Season Strategic Guidance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As a **Roster Copilot** user reviewing my Weekly Strategy Digest, I want to be able to make on-demand queries to the AI Copilot for further detail or clarification on specific suggestions so that I can better understand the advice before acting on it.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  When viewing the "Weekly Strategy Digest" (Story 4.1, e.g., on `app/(main)/copilot/digest/page.tsx`) or a digest summary in the AI Copilot Panel (`AIPanel.tsx`), the user has an option to ask for more details or clarification on specific pieces of advice (e.g., a "Tell me more" button/icon next to an advice item, or a focused query input within the AI Copilot Panel).
2.  (PoC Scope) On-demand queries are focused on the suggestions presented in the current digest context (e.g., "Why is Player X a good waiver target over Player Y who is also available?", "What are the specific risks of starting Player Z this week against Team ABC?").
3.  The "AI Copilot Service" processes these queries, referencing:
    * The user's `UserProfile`.
    * Relevant static data (`NFLPlayer`, `NFLGame`).
    * The context of the original digest suggestion being queried.
4.  The AI Copilot provides a concise, preference-driven explanation (as per Story 4.5) in response to the query.
5.  The response is displayed to the user, likely within the AI Copilot Panel or an expanded section of the digest item/Insight Card.
6.  The interaction feels conversational and provides genuinely helpful additional insight.
7.  The performance NFR for AI Copilot suggestions (targeting 3-5 seconds) applies to query responses.
8.  The `/api/copilot/on-demand-query` (POST) API endpoint (path updated for Roster Copilot, conceptualized in `Architecture.md`) is used.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend ("AI Copilot Service") - On-Demand Query Processing Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Design logic within "AI Copilot Service" to understand and process focused on-demand queries related to specific digest content items. This might involve parsing the query for intent and entities (player names, advice type).
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** Implement logic to retrieve necessary context: the original digest advice being queried, relevant `NFLPlayer`/`NFLGame` data, and the user's `UserProfile`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.3:** Implement logic to generate a more detailed or comparative explanation based on the query and context, incorporating preference-driven styles (Story 4.5).
- [ ] **Task 2: Backend - API Endpoint for On-Demand Queries (`POST /api/copilot/on-demand-query`)**
    - [ ] Create API Route Handler (e.g., `app/api/copilot/on-demand-query/route.ts`).
    - [ ] Endpoint must be protected.
    - [ ] Define request payload: e.g., `{ queryText: string, digestItemId: string, originalAdviceContext: object }`.
    - [ ] Call the "AI Copilot Service" to process the query and get the response.
    - [ ] Return the AI Copilot's textual response.
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware.
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - UI for On-Demand Queries & Displaying Responses**
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.1:** On the "Weekly Strategy Digest" page (`app/(main)/copilot/digest/page.tsx`) and/or within the AI Copilot Panel's digest summary, implement UI elements (e.g., "Tell me more" icon/button per digest item, or a contextual input field).
        * *Dev Note:* The v0.io prompt for `AIPanel.tsx` included an optional input area which could be leveraged here. Individual digest items (cards) might need a small action button.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.2:** When a query is initiated, capture the query text and the context of the digest item it relates to.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.3:** Handle API call to `POST /api/copilot/on-demand-query`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.4:** Display the AI Copilot's response in a clear, conversational format within the AI Copilot Panel or an expanded view of the digest item.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.5:** Handle loading and error states for the API call.
- [ ] **Task 4: AI/Logic (If using external LLM)**
    - [ ] If using Gemini or similar for generating responses, design specific prompts that include the user's query, the original digest advice context, relevant player/game data snippets, and user profile hints for style.
- [ ] **Task 5: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend query processing and response generation logic in "AI Copilot Service."
    - [ ] Unit tests for frontend components handling query input and response display.
    - [ ] Integration test for the `/api/copilot/on-demand-query` API endpoint.
    - [ ] E2E test: User views digest, clicks "Tell me more" or types a query about a specific piece of advice, and receives a relevant, detailed response from the AI Copilot.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend ("AI Copilot Service"):**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for relevant data models and the conceptual role of the "AI Copilot Service."
    - Providing sufficient context (original advice, query, user profile) to the core logic (or LLM prompt) is key for relevant responses.
    - For PoC, the "understanding" of the query can be based on simple keyword matching or by structuring the interaction (e.g., user clicks "Why Player X?" on a specific waiver suggestion).
- **Frontend:**
    - The interaction for on-demand queries should feel like a natural extension of viewing the digest.
    - Displaying the response might involve updating the content of the AI Copilot Panel or dynamically expanding a section of the digest page.
- **Preference-Driven Explanations:** The style of responses should adapt based on Story 4.5 logic.
