# Story 2.1: Core Conversational Fantasy Manager Archetype Selection

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user undergoing AI Copilot onboarding, I want to engage in a basic natural conversation with the AI Copilot to select my "Fantasy Manager Archetype" so that I can establish my initial profile through the chat interface.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  After initial account creation/login and email verification (Story 1.1), the user is directed to the onboarding page where the AI Copilot initiates a conversational onboarding flow through the existing chat interface.
2.  The AI Copilot introduces itself and explains the purpose of archetype selection in a friendly, conversational manner (e.g., "Hi! I'm your AI Copilot. To give you the best personalized advice, I'd like to understand your fantasy football style.").
3.  The AI Copilot presents the four predefined "Fantasy Manager Archetypes" ("Eager Learner," "Calculated Strategist," "Bold Playmaker," "Busy Optimizer") through conversational descriptions rather than visual cards, explaining each archetype's characteristics in an engaging way.
4.  The AI Copilot asks the user to select their preferred archetype through natural language interaction (e.g., "Which of these sounds most like you?" or "You can tell me the name or number of the archetype that resonates with you").
5.  The user can respond with the archetype name, number (1-4), or natural language indicating their choice (e.g., "I'm definitely an Eager Learner" or "Number 2 sounds like me").
6.  The AI Copilot confirms the selection and provides encouraging, personalized feedback about the chosen archetype (e.g., "Great choice! As an Eager Learner, I'll make sure to explain the 'why' behind my advice to help you grow your fantasy skills.").
7.  Upon confirmation, the selected archetype is persisted to the user's `UserProfile` via an API call to `PUT /api/users/me`.
8.  Upon successful persistence of the selection, the conversation proceeds to the next step:
    * If "Eager Learner" is selected, the conversation seamlessly continues to the guided questionnaire (Story 2.2).
    * If another archetype is selected, the onboarding concludes with next steps and navigation guidance.
9.  The conversational flow handles edge cases gracefully:
    * Unclear or ambiguous responses (asks for clarification)
    * Requests for more information about specific archetypes (provides detailed explanations)
    * User wanting to change their selection (allows re-selection)
    * Technical errors during API calls (provides friendly error handling)

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - Leverage existing `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` component for basic conversational interactions
    - Implement simple conversation state tracking for archetype selection process
    - Use basic natural language processing (keyword matching) for user responses
    - Focus on core conversation flow without advanced features
- **Backend:**
    - Use existing `/api/users/me` endpoint for `selectedArchetype` field updates
    - Basic error handling for API failures
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` field
- **Conversation Design:**
    - Keep scripts simple, friendly, and focused on archetype selection
    - Handle basic response patterns (names, numbers, simple descriptions)
- **Scope:** Core functionality only - advanced features (express mode, persistence, voice-ready) handled in separate stories

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4 (BMAD Dev Agent)`

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
- ✅ **Backend API Enhancement**: Extended `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint to handle `selectedArchetype` field updates with proper validation using new `UpdateArchetypeDto` class
- ✅ **Database Layer**: Added `updateUserArchetype()` function to `user.dal.ts` for persisting archetype selections
- ✅ **Conversation Engine**: Created comprehensive conversation management system with `ConversationManager` class and archetype data structures in `src/lib/conversation/`
- ✅ **Natural Language Processing**: Implemented robust parsing logic that handles archetype selection by name, number, or keywords
- ✅ **Chat Interface Integration**: Enhanced `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` to detect users without selected archetypes and initiate onboarding conversation flow
- ✅ **State Management**: Implemented conversation state tracking with proper phase transitions (greeting → presentation → selection → confirmation → complete)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for API failures, unclear responses, and edge cases
- ✅ **Testing**: Created extensive unit tests for conversation logic (17 tests passing) and E2E test framework for full flow validation
- ✅ **Build Validation**: All 318 tests passing, no TypeScript errors, successful build completion

**Key Features Delivered:**

2. **Four Archetype Support**: Complete implementation for Eager Learner, Calculated Strategist, Bold Playmaker, and Busy Optimizer
3. **Flexible Input Handling**: Accepts archetype names, numbers (1-4), or natural language descriptions
4. **Smart Confirmation Flow**: Confirms selections and allows users to change their mind
5. **Transition Logic**: Eager Learner users transition to questionnaire (Story 2.2), others complete onboarding
6. **Robust Error Recovery**: Handles unclear responses, API failures, and provides helpful clarification

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Enhanced existing chat interface with conversation state management
- **Backend**: Extended user profile API with archetype validation
- **Data Flow**: Chat → ConversationManager → API → Database persistence
- **Testing**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for API, E2E tests for full flow

**Story Completion Validation:**
