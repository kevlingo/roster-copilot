# Story 2.1: Core Conversational Fantasy Manager Archetype Selection

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user undergoing AI Copilot onboarding, I want to engage in a basic natural conversation with the AI Copilot to select my "Fantasy Manager Archetype" so that I can establish my initial profile through the chat interface.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  After initial account creation/login and email verification (Story 1.1), the user is directed to the onboarding page where the AI Copilot initiates a conversational onboarding flow through the existing chat interface.
2.  The AI Copilot introduces itself and explains the purpose of archetype selection in a friendly, conversational manner (e.g., "Hi! I'm your AI Copilot. To give you the best personalized advice, I'd like to understand your fantasy football style.").
3.  The AI Copilot presents the four predefined "Fantasy Manager Archetypes" ("Eager Learner," "Calculated Strategist," "Bold Playmaker," "Busy Optimizer") through conversational descriptions rather than visual cards, explaining each archetype's characteristics in an engaging way.
4.  The AI Copilot asks the user to select their preferred archetype through natural language interaction (e.g., "Which of these sounds most like you?" or "You can tell me the name or number of the archetype that resonates with you").
5.  The user can respond with the archetype name, number (1-4), or natural language indicating their choice (e.g., "I'm definitely an Eager Learner" or "Number 2 sounds like me").
6.  The AI Copilot confirms the selection and provides encouraging, personalized feedback about the chosen archetype (e.g., "Great choice! As an Eager Learner, I'll make sure to explain the 'why' behind my advice to help you grow your fantasy skills.").
7.  Upon confirmation, the selected archetype is persisted to the user's `UserProfile` via an API call to `PUT /api/users/me`.
8.  Upon successful persistence of the selection, the conversation proceeds to the next step:
    * If "Eager Learner" is selected, the conversation seamlessly continues to the guided questionnaire (Story 2.2).
    * If another archetype is selected, the onboarding concludes with next steps and navigation guidance.
9.  The conversational flow handles edge cases gracefully:
    * Unclear or ambiguous responses (asks for clarification)
    * Requests for more information about specific archetypes (provides detailed explanations)
    * User wanting to change their selection (allows re-selection)
    * Technical errors during API calls (provides friendly error handling)

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Frontend Development (Next.js 15 + React 19)**
- **Component Architecture**: Leverage existing `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` with React Server Components for better performance
- **State Management**: Use `useActionState` for conversation state tracking and form submissions
- **Conversation Flow**: Implement state machine pattern for robust conversation management:
  ```typescript
  type ConversationState = 'greeting' | 'presentation' | 'selection' | 'confirmation' | 'complete';
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(conversationReducer, 'greeting');
  ```
- **Natural Language Processing**: Enhanced keyword matching with fuzzy string matching for better user experience
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.2 compliance with proper ARIA labels for chat messages and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for long conversation histories

### **Backend API & Data Management (2025 Best Practices)**
- **API Design**: Use existing `/api/users/me` endpoint with enhanced validation using Zod schemas:
  ```typescript
  const ArchetypeUpdateSchema = z.object({
    selectedArchetype: z.enum(['Eager Learner', 'Calculated Strategist', 'Bold Playmaker', 'Busy Optimizer'])
  });
  ```
- **Database Operations**: Use parameterized queries for secure archetype updates
- **Error Handling**: Implement structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect conversation endpoints from abuse
- **Logging**: Track conversation analytics for UX improvements

### **Conversation Design & UX**
- **Script Management**: Maintain conversation scripts in structured JSON/YAML for easy updates
- **Response Patterns**: Support multiple input formats (names, numbers, natural language)
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of unclear responses with helpful prompts
- **Personalization**: Adapt conversation tone based on user preferences
- **Internationalization**: Design for future multi-language support

### **Testing Strategy (2025 Standards)**
- **Unit Testing**: Test conversation logic with comprehensive state transition scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Validate API endpoints with various archetype selection patterns
- **E2E Testing**: Complete conversation flow testing with Playwright
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated testing with axe-core for chat interface compliance
- **Performance Testing**: Conversation response time and memory usage optimization

### **Security & Privacy**
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of conversation data and user preferences
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS
- **Session Management**: Secure conversation state persistence
- **Audit Logging**: Track archetype selection events for compliance
