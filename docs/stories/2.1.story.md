# Story 2.1: Implement Fantasy Manager Archetype Selection Interface

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user undergoing AI Copilot onboarding, I want to be presented with a selection of predefined "Fantasy Manager Archetypes" so that I can choose one that best reflects my initial approach or experience level with fantasy football.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  During the AI Copilot onboarding flow (e.g., on `app/(main)/onboarding/page.tsx` or within the `AIPanel.tsx`), after initial account creation/login and email verification (Story 1.1), the user is presented with an archetype selection interface.
2.  The interface clearly displays the predefined "Fantasy Manager Archetypes" as specified in `Architecture.md` and `Prd.md`: "Eager Learner," "Calculated Strategist," "Bold Playmaker," "Busy Optimizer."
3.  Each archetype option is presented using an engaging UI element, such as an "Archetype Card" (as conceptualized in `UIUX_Spec.md` and detailed for v0.io prompt Story 5).
4.  Each Archetype Card includes a brief, engaging description of its characteristics. The description for "Eager Learner" specifically caters to users new to or still learning fantasy football.
5.  The user can select only one archetype at a time. Selecting one archetype visually indicates its selection and deselects any other.
6.  The user's selection of an archetype is captured by the frontend.
7.  Upon confirming their selection (e.g., via a "Continue" button or by the selection itself being the trigger), the chosen `selectedArchetype` is persisted to the user's `UserProfile` via an API call.
8.  Upon successful persistence of the selection, the system proceeds to the next step in the onboarding flow:
    * If "Eager Learner" is selected, the user is presented with the brief guided questionnaire (as per Story 2.2).
    * If another archetype is selected, the PoC onboarding for archetype/initial questions might conclude here, proceeding to profile confirmation or main app (as per Story 2.3 planning).
9.  The interface for archetype selection is visually appealing, responsive, and easy to use, adhering to the "modern, clean, engaging pop" aesthetic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Ensure Profile Update Capability for Archetype**
    - [ ] Verify the existing `PUT /api/users/me` API endpoint (from Story 1.4) can accept and update the `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` field.
    - [ ] Ensure backend validation allows for the defined archetype string values.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - `ArchetypeCard.tsx` Component**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (Section 5, Component 1: `ArchetypeCard.tsx`) to generate the initial UI and structure for the `ArchetypeCard.tsx` component (to be located in `src/components/ai-copilot/` or `src/components/onboarding/`).
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** Review and adapt the generated `ArchetypeCard.tsx` code. Ensure it meets the visual description (icon, title, description, select action), accepts props (`title`, `description`, `icon`, `isSelected`, `onSelect`), and adheres to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** Implement the visual distinction for a selected card state.
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - Archetype Selection Page/View UI & Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.1:** Develop the UI container on the onboarding page (`app/(main)/onboarding/page.tsx`) or within the `AIPanel.tsx` that displays multiple `ArchetypeCard.tsx` components (one for each archetype).
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.2:** Manage the state for which archetype is currently selected by the user (local component state is likely sufficient).
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.3:** Implement logic so that selecting one card calls its `onSelect` prop and updates the selection state, ensuring only one card can be `isSelected` at a time.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.4:** Implement a "Continue" or "Confirm Archetype" button. On click, this button will:
        - [ ] Trigger an API call to `PUT /api/users/me` with the selected archetype string to update `UserProfile.selectedArchetype`.
        - [ ] On successful API response, navigate the user to the next onboarding step (e.g., questionnaire for "Eager Learner", or dashboard/profile confirmation).
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.5:** Handle API loading and error states appropriately.
- [ ] **Task 4: Content Finalization**
    - [ ] Ensure final, engaging descriptions for each of the four Fantasy Manager Archetypes are available and used in the `ArchetypeCard` components.
- [ ] **Task 5: Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the `ArchetypeCard.tsx` component (rendering with different props, selection behavior).
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the selection page/view logic (managing selection, API call on confirm).
    - [ ] Write an integration test for the `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint specifically for updating the `selectedArchetype`.
    - [ ] Write an E2E test for the archetype selection step of the onboarding flow: user sees cards, selects one, confirms, and the selection is persisted (verifiable if next step changes or by checking profile data if feasible in E2E).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - Leverage the v0.io prompt for the `ArchetypeCard.tsx` component. The Developer Agent will need to ensure it's integrated correctly into the selection page/view.
    - Refer to `Frontend-Architecture.md` for component location, styling (Tailwind/DaisyUI), and state management (local state for selection logic is preferred here).
    - The UI should be intuitive, making it clear which archetype is selected and how to confirm.
- **Backend:**
    - The `/api/users/me` endpoint from Story 1.4 should already support partial updates to `UserProfile`. Ensure it correctly handles the `selectedArchetype` field.
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for the `UserProfile` data model and the specific enum/type for `selectedArchetype`.
- **Content:** Archetype descriptions should be provided or finalized by the PM/PO if placeholder text was used in initial designs.
