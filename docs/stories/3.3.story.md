# Story 3.3: Allow Independent Draft Picks Despite AI Suggestions

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 3 - AI-Powered Draft Assistance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As a user in a live draft for **Roster Copilot**, I want to be able to easily ignore AI Copilot (Draft Day Co-Pilot) suggestions and make my own independent player selections so that I have full control over my draft choices.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  While the AI Copilot panel displays recommendations (as per Story 3.1), the main player selection interface in the Draft Room (from Story 1.8, including the list of available players and pick confirmation mechanism) remains fully functional and easily accessible to the user.
2.  The user can browse, search (if implemented in Story 1.8), and select any available player from the general player pool, regardless of whether that player was recommended by the AI Copilot.
3.  Making an independent pick (selecting a player not specifically highlighted by the AI Copilot) does not require extra steps, dismissals of AI Copilot suggestions, or disabling the AI Copilot.
4.  The process for confirming an independent pick is the same as confirming an AI Copilot-suggested pick (i.e., select player, click "Draft Player" button, as defined in Story 1.8).
5.  The AI Copilot panel (or its UI representation) does not obstruct or impede the user's ability to interact with the main player list or drafting controls.
6.  (Optional for PoC, good UX) After an independent pick is made, the AI Copilot panel may offer a brief, neutral acknowledgement (e.g., "Player X selected for your **Roster Copilot** team.") or simply clear its previous suggestion and prepare for the next relevant event. It MUST NOT be critical or overly persistent about its ignored suggestions.
7.  The `Prd.md` requirement "The UI must allow users to easily ignore suggestions and make their own pick" (referring to the AI Copilot) is met.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Frontend - Ensure Non-Interference of AI Copilot Panel (Draft Room UI)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Review the layout of the Draft Room page (`app/(main)/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx`), particularly the AI Copilot panel area (potentially scaffolded by v0.io and using `AIPanel.tsx`).
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** Verify and ensure that the UI design and implementation allow simultaneous visibility and unimpeded interaction with both the AI Copilot panel (displaying suggestions) and the main player list/drafting controls (from Story 1.8).
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.3:** Confirm that selecting a player from the main player list and using the primary "Draft Player" button works independently of any content or state within the AI Copilot panel.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.4:** (If implementing AC6) Design and implement a neutral acknowledgement message or behavior for the AI Copilot panel post-independent pick.
- [ ] **Task 2: Backend ("AI Copilot Service" & API)**
    - [ ] No direct backend changes are anticipated for this story, as it's primarily a UI/UX and interaction principle. The backend continues to provide advice when requested (Story 3.1) but does not control the user's ability to pick.
    - [ ] Confirm the API for making a draft pick (from Story 1.8, e.g., `/api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/pick`) accepts any valid available player ID, not just AI Copilot-suggested ones (this should inherently be the case).
- [ ] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [ ] Write/Update E2E test for the draft flow:
        - User's turn in draft, AI Copilot provides suggestions.
        - User ignores suggestions, browses the main player list, selects a different available player.
        - User successfully drafts the independently selected player.
        - Verify the AI Copilot panel did not interfere and behaved neutrally post-pick.

- [ ] **Task 4: Build and Test Validation**
    - [ ] Build completed successfully with no errors
    - [ ] All tests passing (37 test suites, 301 tests passed)
    - [ ] Fixed NextResponse mocking issues in API tests
    - [ ] Component tests, unit tests, and integration tests all pass
    - [ ] Fixed syntax errors in component integration

- [ ] **Task 5: Story Completion**
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
    - [ ] Users can draft independently of AI Copilot suggestions
    - [ ] AI Copilot panel does not interfere with main drafting functionality
    - [ ] Proper loading states, error handling, and accessibility features implemented
    - [ ] Story marked as Complete following BMAD methodology

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - This story heavily emphasizes UI/UX design to ensure the AI Copilot's suggestions are an aid, not a hindrance. Refer to `UIUX_Spec.md` and `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - The layout for the AI Copilot panel within the Draft Room (potentially guided by v0.io output) must be carefully considered to not overshadow or block core drafting interactions.
    - No complex new logic is expected; this story largely confirms that the drafting functionality from Story 1.8 is not negatively impacted by the presence of AI Copilot suggestions from Story 3.1.
- **Focus:** The main work is in the frontend to ensure a seamless experience where users feel empowered to make their own choices, even when AI Copilot offers alternatives.
