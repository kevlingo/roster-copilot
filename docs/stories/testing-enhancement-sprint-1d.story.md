# Testing Enhancement Sprint 1D: Story 1.13 - League Standings Testing

## Status: Not Started

## Epic: Testing Enhancement

## Story

As a development team, I want focused testing patterns added to Story 1.13 (League Standings) so that coding agents can implement robust table testing and data visualization tests without getting stuck in testing loops and this story can be completed with comprehensive test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria (6 Tasks)

1. **Research Phase**: Current 2025 testing best practices are researched for table testing, sorting algorithms, and data visualization validation.
2. **Pain Point Analysis**: Common coding agent testing pain points are identified and documented for table component and algorithm testing challenges.
3. **Focused Testing Creation**: Comprehensive testing section (~100-150 lines) is created with practical TypeScript examples and 2025 best practices.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Changelog is updated for Story 1.13 with testing enhancement entry dated 2025-06-07.
5. **Quality Validation**: Updated story is validated for proper integration, formatting, and testing section placement before "Current Implementation References".
6. **Testing Completion**: Story 1.13 testing enhancement is marked complete and ready for development implementation.
