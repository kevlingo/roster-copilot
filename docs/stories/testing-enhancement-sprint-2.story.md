# Testing Enhancement Sprint 2: Epic 2 Foundation

## Status: Not Started

## Epic: Testing Enhancement

## Story

As a development team, I want focused testing patterns added to Epic 2 user stories (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) so that coding agents can implement robust tests without getting stuck in testing loops and Epic 2 can be completed with comprehensive test coverage for advanced league management features.

## Acceptance Criteria (5 Tasks)

1. **Research Phase**: Current 2025 testing best practices are researched for each story's specific tech stack (league settings management, commissioner tools, advanced roster configurations).
2. **Pain Point Analysis**: Common coding agent testing pain points are identified and documented for each story's unique technical challenges.
3. **Focused Testing Creation**: Comprehensive testing sections (~100-150 lines each) are created for all 3 stories with practical TypeScript examples and 2025 best practices.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Changelogs are updated for all 3 stories with testing enhancement entries dated 2025-06-07.
5. **Quality Validation**: All updated stories are validated for proper integration, formatting, and testing section placement before "Current Implementation References".

## Stories in This Sprint

### Epic 2 - Advanced League Management & Commissioner Tools

1. **Story 2.1 - League Settings Management**

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Administrative Interface Testing Methodology (2025 Standards)**

This sprint focuses on Epic 2's administrative complexity with comprehensive testing strategies for league management, commissioner tools, and advanced configurations. Each story receives targeted testing guidance for administrative interface challenges.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- **Form Validation Testing**: Complex nested forms, async validation, error state management
- **Permission & Security Testing**: Role-based access control, privilege boundaries, security validation
- **Configuration Testing**: Rule validation, mathematical accuracy, conflict detection
- **Administrative Workflows**: Bulk operations, transaction integrity, audit trail validation

**Success Criteria:**
- All Epic 2 stories have focused testing sections (~100-150 lines each)
- Testing patterns address administrative interface complexity
- Examples use current 2025 best practices for form and security testing
- Documentation covers commissioner tool requirements and edge cases
