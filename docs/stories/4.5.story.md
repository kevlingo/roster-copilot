# Story 4.5: Implement "Preference-Driven Explanation Style" for AI Copilot Advice

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 4 - AI-Driven In-Season Strategic Guidance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As a **Roster Copilot** user receiving advice from the AI Copilot, I want the style, depth, and focus of the rationale behind the advice to be dynamically adapted based on my established User Preference Profile so that the explanations are consistently relevant and easy for me to understand.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The "AI Copilot Service" (`Architecture.md`), when generating explanations for its advice (e.g., for draft recommendations - Story 3.1, weekly digest items - Story 4.1, on-demand query responses - Story 4.2), accesses the user's `UserProfile`.
2.  The service uses preferences such as `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` and `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers.preferredExplanationDepth` (e.g., "simple," "standard," "detailed") to modify the style, depth, and focus of the generated explanation text.
3.  (PoC Scope) The system demonstrates at least two distinct explanation styles based on these user preferences. For example:
    * **Style 1 (e.g., for "Eager Learner" with `preferredExplanationDepth: "simple"`):** Explanation is very concise (1-2 sentences), uses basic terminology, focuses on the single most important reason, and might be more encouraging in tone.
    * **Style 2 (e.g., for "Calculated Strategist" or if `preferredExplanationDepth: "detailed"`):** Explanation is more analytical (2-3 sentences), may include a key supporting statistic (from static PoC data if available and relevant) or a slightly deeper strategic point, and uses standard fantasy football terminology.
4.  The mechanism for selecting and applying the appropriate explanation style is implemented within the "AI Copilot Service."
5.  The explanations, regardless of style, remain clear, directly link the AI Copilot's advice to relevant insights (simplified for PoC) or user preferences, and maintain factual accuracy based on the PoC static data.
6.  This feature is demonstrated in conjunction with at least one AI Copilot advice-giving feature (e.g., draft recommendations or weekly digest advice).
7.  The `Prd.md` requirement for "Basic 'Explain My Advice' Feature (Revised)" with adaptable style for **Roster Copilot** is met.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend ("AI Copilot Service") - Explanation Style Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Design the logic within the "AI Copilot Service" to select an explanation style based on `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` and `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers.preferredExplanationDepth`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** Develop or select distinct explanation templates or generation strategies for at least two different styles (e.g., "Simple/Eager Learner Style," "Detailed/Strategist Style").
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.3:** Enhance existing advice generation functions (for draft, digest, queries) in the "AI Copilot Service" to:
        - [ ] Accept `UserProfile` data or derived style preference as input.
        - [ ] Generate or select the explanation text according to the chosen style.
- [ ] **Task 2: AI/Logic (If using external LLM for explanations)**
    - [ ] If using Gemini or similar for generating explanations, refine prompts to instruct the LLM to adopt different styles, tones, and depths based on input parameters derived from the `UserProfile` (e.g., passing a "style_preference: simple" parameter to the LLM prompt).
    - [ ] Develop example prompts for each targeted style to guide LLM behavior.
- [ ] **Task 3: Content - Define Explanation Styles & Examples**
    - [ ] Create example explanation texts for the different defined styles across various advice scenarios (e.g., a waiver pickup suggestion explained in "simple" style vs. "detailed" style). This will guide implementation and testing.
- [ ] **Task 4: Frontend - Ensure UI Accommodates Varying Explanations**
    - [ ] No new UI components are likely needed specifically for this story.
    - [ ] Verify that existing UI components that display AI Copilot explanations (e.g., in AI Copilot Panel, Draft Room, Digest Page) can gracefully handle slightly varying lengths and formats of explanation text resulting from different styles.
- [ ] **Task 5: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for the explanation style selection and generation logic in the "AI Copilot Service." Test with different `UserProfile` inputs.
    - [ ] Update integration tests for advice-generating API endpoints (e.g., `/api/copilot/draft-advice`, `/api/copilot/weekly-digest`) to verify that the explanations in the response reflect the appropriate style based on the test user's profile.
    - [ ] E2E test:
        - As a user with "Eager Learner" profile and "simple" explanation preference, view an AI Copilot recommendation and verify the explanation is concise and simple.
        - As a user with a different profile (e.g., "Calculated Strategist") or "detailed" preference, view a similar recommendation and verify a more in-depth explanation.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend ("AI Copilot Service"):**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for the `UserProfile` data model (specifically `selectedArchetype`, `onboardingAnswers.preferredExplanationDepth`) and the role of the "AI Copilot Service."
    - The core of this story is the backend service's ability to dynamically adjust its textual output.
    - For PoC, the "styles" can be achieved through conditional logic and different text templates/structures if not using an LLM. If using an LLM, prompt engineering is key.
    - Ensure the default style (if preferences are not set) is sensible (e.g., "standard" depth).
- **Frontend:**
    - Primarily involves rendering text provided by the backend. The main consideration is ensuring layout flexibility for potentially different explanation lengths.
- **Content & Consistency:** The defined styles should be applied consistently wherever the AI Copilot provides explanations.
