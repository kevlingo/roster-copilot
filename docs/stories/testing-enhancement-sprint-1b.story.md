# Testing Enhancement Sprint 1B: Story 1.11 - Add/Drop Players Testing

## Status: Not Started

## Epic: Testing Enhancement

## Story

As a development team, I want focused testing patterns added to Story 1.11 (Add/Drop Players) so that coding agents can implement robust API integration and real-time sync tests without getting stuck in testing loops and this story can be completed with comprehensive test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria (6 Tasks)

1. **Research Phase**: Current 2025 testing best practices are researched for data aggregation, real-time updates, and responsive design testing.
2. **Pain Point Analysis**: Common coding agent testing pain points are identified and documented for API integration and real-time sync challenges.
3. **Focused Testing Creation**: Comprehensive testing section (~100-150 lines) is created with practical TypeScript examples and 2025 best practices.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Changelog is updated for Story 1.11 with testing enhancement entry dated 2025-06-07.
5. **Quality Validation**: Updated story is validated for proper integration, formatting, and testing section placement before "Current Implementation References".
6. **Testing Completion**: Story 1.11 testing enhancement is marked complete and ready for development implementation.
