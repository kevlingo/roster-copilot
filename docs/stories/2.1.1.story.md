# Story 2.1.1: Express Mode Archetype Selection

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user in a social situation (like a draft party), I want a quick archetype selection option so that I can complete onboarding efficiently without appearing inexperienced in front of friends.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Story 2.1 (Core Conversational Archetype Selection) must be completed
- **Integration:** Extends Story 2.1's conversation flow with express mode option

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. After the AI Copilot greeting, users are presented with a mode selection choice: "Quick Setup" or "Let's Chat"
2. When "Quick Setup" is selected, the AI presents all four archetypes in a concise, streamlined format
3. The express mode conversation is optimized for speed while maintaining clarity about each archetype
4. Users can select their archetype using the same response methods (name, number, description) as the full mode
5. Express mode includes brief confirmation and immediate completion without extended conversation
6. The selected archetype is persisted to `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` via the same API as Story 2.1
7. Express mode transitions appropriately: Eager Learner users proceed to Story 2.2, others complete onboarding
8. Users can switch from express mode to full conversation mode if they change their mind
9. The express mode maintains the same error handling and response processing as the core conversation

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - Extend existing conversation state management from Story 2.1
    - Add mode selection and express flow routing to existing chat integration
    - Reuse existing response processing with express mode optimizations
- **Backend:**
    - Use same API endpoints and data models as Story 2.1
    - No additional backend changes required
- **Conversation Design:**
    - Keep express mode scripts concise but informative
    - Maintain friendly tone while optimizing for speed
    - Ensure express mode feels efficient, not rushed
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with Story 2.1 foundation and Story 2.2 transitions

## Story Progress Notes
