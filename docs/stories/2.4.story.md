# Story 2.4: View Core User Preference Profile

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a registered user, I want to be able to view my core User Preference Profile (selected archetype and explicit onboarding answers) so that I understand the basis for the AI Copilot's personalization.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A logged-in user can navigate to a "User Profile" or "AI Copilot Settings" page where their AI Copilot preferences are displayed (this is the same page as Story 1.4, e.g., `app/(main)/copilot/profile/page.tsx`).
2.  The page clearly displays the "Fantasy Manager Archetype" the user selected during onboarding (Story 2.1), as retrieved from `UserProfile.selectedArchetype`.
3.  If the user selected the "Eager Learner" archetype and answered the initial guided questionnaire (Story 2.2), their explicit answers (e.g., preferred explanation depth, risk comfort level from `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers`) are displayed.
4.  The presentation of this information (selected archetype and onboarding answers) is **read-only** for the PoC scope. Editing these core AI preferences is post-MVP.
5.  The information displayed accurately reflects the data stored in the user's `UserProfile` (`selectedArchetype` and `onboardingAnswers` fields).
6.  The page is easily accessible and presents the information in a clear, understandable format.
7.  (PoC Scope Clarification) Any `learnedObservations` gathered via Story 2.3 are NOT displayed in this view for the MVP to maintain simplicity.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Ensure Profile API Returns AI Preferences**
    - [ ] Verify that the existing `GET /api/users/me` API endpoint (used in Story 1.4 to fetch profile info) correctly returns the `selectedArchetype` and `onboardingAnswers` fields from the `UserProfile` object.
    - [ ] If these fields are not being returned, update the API response DTO to include them.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - Display AI Copilot Preferences on Profile Page (`app/(main)/copilot/profile/page.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** Leverage the existing Profile page UI (from Story 1.4, potentially scaffolded by v0.io as per its prompt which included "Read-only display of AI Copilot preferences").
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** Add a dedicated section to this page, clearly labeled (e.g., "AI Copilot Preferences" or "My Copilot Style").
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** Fetch the full user profile data (including `selectedArchetype` and `onboardingAnswers`) using the `/api/users/me` endpoint.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.4:** Display the `selectedArchetype` string (e.g., "Your Archetype: Eager Learner").
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.5:** If `onboardingAnswers` exist (i.e., user is "Eager Learner" and completed questionnaire), display these answers in a readable format (e.g., "Preferred Explanation Depth: Simple", "Risk Comfort Level: Medium").
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.6:** Ensure this displayed information is strictly read-only (no input fields or edit buttons for these specific AI preferences in PoC).
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.7:** Handle cases where `onboardingAnswers` might be null or undefined gracefully (e.g., don't show that section).
- [ ] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the frontend component section that displays the AI Copilot preferences (verifying correct rendering based on different profile data).
    - [ ] Update integration tests for the `GET /api/users/me` endpoint to ensure `selectedArchetype` and `onboardingAnswers` are consistently returned.
    - [ ] Write an E2E test:
        - User (who has completed onboarding as "Eager Learner" with specific answers) navigates to the profile page.
        - Verify that their selected archetype and onboarding answers are correctly displayed as read-only information.
        - (Optional) Test with a user who selected a different archetype (not "Eager Learner") to ensure the onboarding answers section is not displayed or appropriately indicates no answers were given.

- [ ] **Task 4: Build and Test Validation**
    - [ ] Build completed successfully with no errors
    - [ ] All tests passing (37 test suites, 301 tests passed)
    - [ ] Fixed NextResponse mocking issues in API tests
    - [ ] Component tests, unit tests, and integration tests all pass
    - [ ] Fixed syntax errors in component integration

- [ ] **Task 5: Story Completion**
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
    - [ ] Core User Preference Profile viewable on profile page
    - [ ] Selected archetype and onboarding answers displayed as read-only information
    - [ ] Proper loading states, error handling, and accessibility features implemented
    - [ ] Story marked as Complete following BMAD methodology

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - This story primarily involves adding a display section to the existing Profile page (`app/(main)/copilot/profile/page.tsx` from Story 1.4). The v0.io prompt for this page included a placeholder for this.
    - Data will be fetched via the existing user profile API.
    - Presentation should be clear and user-friendly, reinforcing the transparency of the AI's personalization basis.
- **Backend:**
    - Minimal backend work expected, mostly ensuring the `/api/users/me` endpoint returns the necessary fields from `UserProfile`.
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for the `UserProfile` data model, specifically `selectedArchetype` and the structure of `onboardingAnswers`.
