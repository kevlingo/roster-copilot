# Story 4.4: Bench Player Replacement Suggestions in Injury Alerts

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 4 - AI-Driven In-Season Strategic Guidance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As a **Roster Copilot** user who receives a critical alert about a player injury on my roster, I want the alert to include immediate, viable replacement suggestions from my current bench (if suitable options exist) so that I can quickly address the lineup gap.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  When a "Critical Alert" is generated by the "AI Copilot Service" due to a player on the user's active roster being marked as "Injured_Out" (as per Story 4.3 and `Prd.md`), the service also checks the user's current bench (`FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster` not in the current starting lineup from Story 1.10 data) for suitable replacements.
2.  A suitable bench replacement for PoC is defined as a player who:
    * Plays the same position (e.g., RB for RB) as the injured player. (Flex position logic is out of scope for PoC).
    * Is healthy/active themselves (e.g., their `NFLPlayer.status` is "Active" and not on a "Bye Week" for the current `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek`).
3.  If one or more suitable bench replacements are found, the critical injury alert payload (generated by the "AI Copilot Service" and fetched via `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check`) includes these players as immediate replacement options.
4.  For each suggested bench replacement displayed in the UI (via `AIPanel.tsx`), basic relevant information is shown: `fullName`, `position`, and `projectedPoints` (from static `NFLPlayer` data).
5.  The alert may also still mention considering waiver targets (as per `Prd.md` general guidance), but this story focuses on the bench suggestions.
6.  If no suitable bench replacements are found, the alert (or its payload) indicates this (e.g., "No immediate bench replacements found. Consider checking the waiver wire.").

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend ("AI Copilot Service") - Bench Replacement Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Enhance the critical injury alert generation logic (from Story 4.3) within the "AI Copilot Service."
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** After detecting an "Injured_Out" player on the user's roster, implement logic to:
        - [ ] Fetch the user's current lineup for the week (from Story 1.10 data) to identify benched players.
        - [ ] Iterate through benched `NFLPlayer` records.
        - [ ] For each benched player, check if they are a suitable replacement (same position as injured player, "Active" status, not on bye week).
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.3:** Augment the critical alert data payload returned by `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check` to include any identified suitable bench replacement suggestions (e.g., an array of player IDs and key info). If none, include an indicator for this.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - Display Bench Suggestions in Critical Alerts (in `AIPanel.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** Update the UI in `AIPanel.tsx` (or the specific alert component) that displays critical alerts (from Story 4.3).
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** If the alert payload contains bench replacement suggestions, display them clearly as part of the alert message (e.g., "Player X is injured. Consider starting: [Player A (RB, Proj: Y pts)], [Player B (RB, Proj: Z pts)] from your bench.").
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** If no bench replacements are suggested in the payload, display the appropriate message (e.g., "No immediate bench replacements found.").
- [ ] **Task 3: Data Simulation**
    - [ ] Ensure `NFLPlayer` static data allows for scenarios where a rostered player becomes "Injured_Out" and there are suitable (and unsuitable) players on the bench to test the logic.
    - [ ] Ensure `NFLGame` data is available to check for bye weeks for benched players.
- [ ] **Task 4: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for the backend bench replacement identification logic (correctly identifying suitable players based on position, status, bye week).
    - [ ] Unit tests for the frontend logic that formats and displays bench suggestions within an alert.
    - [ ] Update integration tests for `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check` to verify the payload includes bench suggestions when appropriate.
    - [ ] E2E test: Simulate a player injury; user receives a critical alert that correctly suggests a suitable player from their bench. Also, test a scenario where no suitable bench player is available and the message reflects this.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend ("AI Copilot Service"):**
    - Requires access to the user's current lineup data (from Story 1.10 implementation) to distinguish starters from bench players accurately.
    - The logic for "suitable position" for PoC should be a direct match (e.g., injured RB can only be replaced by another RB from bench suggestions).
    - Ensure bye week checks use the `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek` and `NFLGame` data.
- **Frontend (`AIPanel.tsx`):**
    - The display of bench suggestions should be clear and concise within the alert.
    - Consider making suggested player names clickable to view their full profile (Story 1.14) if that integration is straightforward.
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for `FantasyTeam_PoC` (roster, lineup info), `NFLPlayer` (status, position, projectedPoints), `NFLGame` (for bye weeks).
