# Story 5.5: Implement Chat Settings and Clear History Functionality

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a user
- I want to access chat settings, including an option to clear the chat history
- so that I can manage my chat data and preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** A `ChatSettings.tsx` component is created.
2.  **AC2:** The component renders a standard settings (cog) icon, as per UI Spec section 2.4.4 and 2.5.
3.  **AC3:** The settings icon is positioned within the `ChatInput` component area, to the right of the 'Hide Chat' button, as per UI Spec sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.4.
4.  **AC4:** Clicking/tapping the settings icon opens a small dropdown/popover.
5.  **AC5:** The popover contains a "Clear Chat History" button/link.
6.  **AC6:** Clicking "Clear Chat History" prompts the user for confirmation (e.g., "Are you sure you want to clear the chat history? This cannot be undone.").
7.  **AC7:** Upon confirmation, all messages are cleared from the `ChatBubbleOverlay` and the associated `chatHistory` state in `PersistentChatInterface`.
8.  **AC8:** The settings icon handles default, hover/focus, and active (popover open) states.
9.  **AC9:** All interactive elements (settings icon, popover, clear history button, confirmation) are keyboard accessible and have clear focus indicators (UI Spec 2.7).
10. **AC10:** `aria-label` is provided for the icon-only settings button and other relevant controls (UI Spec 2.7).

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   Refer to UI/UX Design Spec section 2.4.4 (`ChatSettings`) and 2.5 (Iconography) in [`docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md`](docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md).
-   Component path: `src/components/ai-chat/ChatSettings.tsx` as per Frontend Architecture Plan (section 3.1).
-   Receives `onClearHistory` handler from its parent component, `ChatInput.tsx` (which in turn gets it from `PersistentChatInterface.tsx`).
-   Manages its own popover visibility state.
-   Icons: Use Heroicons.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- **Updated 2025-06-03:** This story has been updated to reflect a design change where the `ChatSettings` button is now a child of the `ChatInput` component, rather than `ChatBubbleOverlay`. The ACs, guidance, and integration points have been adjusted accordingly.
- Implemented `ChatSettings.tsx` component with a cog icon button to open a popover.
- Popover contains a "Clear Chat History" button which prompts for confirmation before calling the `onClearHistory` prop.
- Used `@heroicons/react` for the cog icon, as approved.
- Integrated `ChatSettings` into `ChatInput.tsx` (reflecting design change).
- Unit tests created for `ChatSettings.tsx` and existing tests for parent components updated. All relevant tests are passing.
- Project build fails due to pre-existing lint errors in unrelated files. This story's changes do not introduce new build or lint errors.

### Change Log

---
**Dependency Approval Request (2025-06-03):**
- **Dependency:** `@heroicons/react`
- **Reason:** Required for the settings (cog) icon as specified in UI/UX Design Spec (section 2.5, line 170) and Dev Technical Guidance (line 49). This library is not currently in `package.json`.
- **Alternatives Considered:** `lucide-react` is an existing dependency and could be used, but project documentation specifies Heroicons.
- **User Approved `@heroicons/react` on 2025-06-03.**
