# Story 4.3: Implement Proactive Critical Alerts

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 4 - AI-Driven In-Season Strategic Guidance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As an active **Roster Copilot** user, I want to receive proactive "Critical Alerts" from the AI Copilot for urgent, high-impact events relevant to my team so that I can take timely action.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The "AI Copilot Service" (`Architecture.md`) identifies predefined critical events using the static PoC dataset.
    * For PoC, a critical event is: A key player (e.g., starter-quality) on the user's active roster (`FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`) is newly marked as "Injured_Out" in `NFLPlayer.status` for the current `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek`.
2.  (PoC Scope) The system implements 1-2 specific critical alert scenarios based on simulated changes in static `NFLPlayer` data (e.g., status changing from "Active" to "Injured_Out").
3.  When a critical event is detected for a user's team, a prominent alert is presented via:
    * The AI Copilot Panel (`AIPanel.tsx` as per `UIUX_Spec.md` and v0.io prompt Story 5).
    * (Optional for PoC) A subtle toast notification if the user is active but not viewing the panel.
4.  The alert clearly communicates the urgent event (e.g., "Critical Alert for Roster Copilot: Player X on your roster is now OUT for this week's game!").
5.  The alert provides immediate, actionable context (specific replacement suggestions are covered in Story 4.4). This alert focuses on flagging urgency.
6.  The user can acknowledge/dismiss the alert from the AI Copilot Panel, preventing repeated "new" notifications for the same event instance.
7.  The "AI Copilot Service" triggers these alerts. For PoC, this might involve the frontend polling `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check` (`Architecture.md` conceptual endpoint) or a backend mechanism flagging users needing alerts.
8.  Alerts are for genuinely critical, high-impact events to avoid alert fatigue.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend ("AI Copilot Service") - Critical Event Detection Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Define PoC logic in "AI Copilot Service" to monitor/detect critical player status changes (e.g., "Injured_Out") for players on active user rosters.
        * This might involve the service checking `NFLPlayer.status` against a "last known status" for players on rosters, or having specific flags in static data simulate status changes.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** Implement logic to generate an alert payload when a new critical event is detected for a user.
- [ ] **Task 2: Backend - API Endpoint for Critical Alerts (`GET /api/copilot/critical-alert-check`)**
    - [ ] Create API Route Handler (e.g., `app/api/copilot/critical-alert-check/route.ts`).
    - [ ] Endpoint must be protected.
    - [ ] When called, it checks if any new critical alerts (based on Task 1 logic) need to be generated/delivered for the authenticated user.
    - [ ] Returns a list of pending critical alert payloads (or an empty list).
    - [ ] Implement a mechanism server-side to track acknowledged alerts per user to avoid re-sending them as "new" via this polling endpoint (e.g., storing acknowledged alert IDs/timestamps in `UserProfile.acknowledgedAlerts` or a separate small table).
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware.
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - Display Critical Alerts & Handle Acknowledgement (in `AIPanel.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.1:** Modify `AIPanel.tsx` (or a dedicated alerts component within it) to:
        - [ ] Periodically poll `GET /api/copilot/critical-alert-check`.
        - [ ] If new alerts are received, display them prominently (e.g., special styling, at the top of the panel).
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.2:** For each alert, display the message and provide a "Dismiss" or "Acknowledge" button.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.3:** On dismiss/acknowledge, call a new backend API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/copilot/acknowledge-alert`) to mark the alert as seen by the user so it's not re-fetched as new by the polling mechanism.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.4:** (Optional for PoC) Implement a simple toast notification component for new critical alerts.
- [ ] **Task 4: Backend - API Endpoint to Acknowledge Alert (`POST /api/copilot/acknowledge-alert`)**
    - [ ] Create API Route Handler.
    - [ ] Input: `alertId`.
    - [ ] Mark the specified alert as acknowledged for the user in the backend persistence layer.
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware.
- [ ] **Task 5: Data Simulation**
    - [ ] Ensure `NFLPlayer` static data can be modified or structured to simulate a player's status changing to "Injured_Out" to trigger the alert for testing.
- [ ] **Task 6: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend critical event detection logic.
    - [ ] Unit tests for frontend alert display and dismissal logic.
    - [ ] Integration tests for `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check` and `/api/copilot/acknowledge-alert` API endpoints.
    - [ ] E2E test: Simulate a player injury in data; user logs in/is active; critical alert appears in UI; user dismisses alert; alert does not reappear as new on subsequent checks.

- [ ] **Task 7: Build and Test Validation**
    - [ ] Build completed successfully with no errors
    - [ ] All tests passing (37 test suites, 301 tests passed)
    - [ ] Fixed NextResponse mocking issues in API tests
    - [ ] Component tests, unit tests, and integration tests all pass
    - [ ] Fixed syntax errors in component integration

- [ ] **Task 8: Story Completion**
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
    - [ ] Critical alerts for player injuries displayed in AI Copilot Panel
    - [ ] Users can acknowledge and dismiss alerts to prevent re-notification
    - [ ] Proper loading states, error handling, and accessibility features implemented
    - [ ] Story marked as Complete following BMAD methodology

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend ("AI Copilot Service"):**
    - For PoC, "detecting" events can be simplified. The `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check` endpoint could query players on the user's roster and identify any whose `NFLPlayer.status` is currently "Injured_Out" and for whom an "Injured_Out" alert hasn't been recently acknowledged.
    - Managing acknowledged alerts is key to prevent re-notifying. This could be a simple array of alert IDs/timestamps in `UserProfile.learnedObservations` or a dedicated small table if more structure is needed.
- **Frontend (`AIPanel.tsx`):**
    - Polling frequency for `/api/copilot/critical-alert-check` should be reasonable (e.g., every 30-60 seconds when the app is active).
    - Alerts should be visually distinct and clearly convey urgency.
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile`, `FantasyTeam_PoC`, `NFLPlayer`. Consider adding `acknowledgedAlerts: string[]` or similar to `UserProfile` if that's the chosen method for tracking.
