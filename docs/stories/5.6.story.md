# Story 5.6: Implement Persistent Chat Interface Container Component

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a developer
- I need a container component for the AI chat interface
- so that I can manage the overall state and interactions of the chat feature.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** A `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` container component is created.
2.  **AC2:** The component manages the overall chat state, including `chatHistory: Array<MessageObject>`, `inputValue: string`, `isOverlayVisible: boolean`, and `isLoadingResponse: boolean` (UI Spec 3.2.1).
3.  **AC3:** The `MessageObject` interface is defined as `{ id: string, text: string, sender: 'user' | 'ai', timestamp: Date }` (UI Spec 3.2.1). (To be placed in `src/types/chat.ts`).
4.  **AC4:** The component renders `ChatInput.tsx` and `ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx`.
5.  **AC5:** It passes necessary props (current input value, handlers) to `ChatInput`.
6.  **AC6:** It passes necessary props (messages array, visibility status, control handlers) to `ChatBubbleOverlay`.
7.  **AC7:** Implements `handleSendMessage(message: string)` function that:
    *   Adds the user's message (as a `MessageObject` with a unique ID, text, sender 'user', and current timestamp) to the `chatHistory` state.
    *   Sets `isLoadingResponse` state to `true`.
    *   Clears the `inputValue` state.
    *   Simulates an AI service interaction by:
        *   Waiting for a short, predefined delay (e.g., 1-2 seconds) to mimic network latency and processing time.
        *   Generating a mock AI response (as a `MessageObject` with a unique ID, predefined or simple echoed text, sender 'ai', and current timestamp).
        *   Adding this mock AI response to the `chatHistory` state.
    *   Sets `isLoadingResponse` state to `false` after the simulated AI response has been added to `chatHistory`.
8.  **AC8:** Implements handler for toggling `isOverlayVisible` (connected to `HideChatButton`).
9.  **AC9:** Implements handler for clearing `chatHistory` (connected to `ChatSettings`).
10. **AC10:** (Optional but Recommended) Considers using a state management library like Zustand or Jotai for scalability, or React Context for simpler cases (UI Spec 3.2.2). If localStorage persistence is implemented (UI Spec 3.2.3), it should be handled here.
11. **AC11:** Focus is managed logically when chat opens/closes (UI Spec 2.7).
12. **AC12:** The overall interface correctly manages `z-index` and pointer events to allow interaction with the underlying page (UI Spec 3.5).

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   Refer to UI/UX Design Spec section 3.1 (`PersistentChatInterface`) and section 3.2 (State Management), 3.4 (API Integration Conceptual), 3.5 (Performance & Optimization) in [`docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md`](docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md).
-   Component path: `src/components/ai-chat/PersistentChatInterface.tsx`.
-   This component is the main orchestrator for the chat feature.
-   For PoC, AI interaction can be mocked/simulated if a live backend isn't ready.
-   Directory for types: `src/types/chat.ts`.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented scroll-from-bottom for [`ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx`](src/components/ai-chat/ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx:1) and narrower message width for [`ChatMessageBubble.tsx`](src/components/ai-chat/ChatMessageBubble.tsx:1) as per task on 2025-06-03. Existing tests reviewed and deemed sufficient for these specific UI refinements.
{Any further notes about implementation choices, difficulties, or follow-up needed}

### Dependency Approvals
- **`@types/uuid`**:
    - **Requested:** 2025-06-03
    - **Reason:** Provides TypeScript type definitions for the `uuid` library, used for unique message IDs (AC7).
    - **Status:** Approved by User on 2025-06-03

### Change Log
- **Created:** `src/components/ai-chat/PersistentChatInterface.tsx`
- **Created:** `src/types/chat.ts`
- **Created:** `src/components/ai-chat/ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx` (placeholder)
- **Created:** `src/components/ai-chat/PersistentChatInterface.test.tsx`
- **Modified:** `src/components/ai-chat/ChatInput.tsx` (Added `React.forwardRef` for focus management and `displayName`)
- **Modified:** `package.json` (Added `@types/uuid` to `devDependencies`)
- **Modified:** `package-lock.json` (Updated due to `@types/uuid` installation)
