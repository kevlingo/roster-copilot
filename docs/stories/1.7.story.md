# Story 1.7: Join an Existing League

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a registered and logged-in user, I want to be able to join an existing fantasy football league so that I can participate with others.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A logged-in user can access an option to "Join League" (e.g., from their main dashboard `app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` or a league selection page, as detailed in `UIUX_Spec.md`). This might lead to a dedicated page like `app/(main)/league/join/page.tsx` or a modal.
2.  The "Join League" interface requires the user to input a League ID (a unique identifier for a `League_PoC`).
3.  The system validates if the entered League ID corresponds to an existing `League_PoC` record.
4.  The system validates if the league is open for new members (i.e., the current number of `participatingTeamIds` in `League_PoC` is less than `League_PoC.numberOfTeams`).
5.  For the PoC, the system validates that the `League_PoC.draftStatus` is "Scheduled" (users cannot join a league if the draft is "InProgress" or "Completed").
6.  Upon successful validation (League ID exists, league has space, draft not started/completed):
    * A new `FantasyTeam_PoC` record is created for the user in that league. This record includes a system-generated unique `teamId`, the `leagueId`, the `userId` of the joining user, and a default `teamName` (e.g., "{Username}'s Team" - user can change this later if a separate "edit team" story is implemented). The `playerIds_onRoster` array will be empty initially.
    * The new `FantasyTeam_PoC.teamId` is added to the `League_PoC.participatingTeamIds` array for the joined league.
7.  The user is informed of successful league join (e.g., via a success message) and is able to navigate to the league's dashboard (e.g., `/league/[leagueId]/dashboard`). This might be an automatic redirect.
8.  If the League ID is invalid, the league is full, the draft has already started/completed, or joining is not possible for other reasons, a clear error message is displayed to the user.
9.  For the PoC, joining a league does not require commissioner approval; it's an open join if space and conditions allow.
10. A user cannot join the same league more than once.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Join League API Endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/leagues/[leagueId]/join`)**
    - [ ] Create API Route Handler (e.g., `app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/join/route.ts`).
    - [ ] The endpoint should be protected, requiring an authenticated user.
    - [ ] Validate the `leagueId` from the path.
    - [ ] Retrieve the `League_PoC` by `leagueId`. If not found, return 404.
    - [ ] Check if the user is already a participant in the league (to prevent joining multiple times). If so, return an appropriate error (e.g., 409 Conflict).
    - [ ] Check if `League_PoC.participatingTeamIds.length < League_PoC.numberOfTeams`. If full, return error (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
    - [ ] Check if `League_PoC.draftStatus` is "Scheduled". If not, return error (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
    - [ ] If all checks pass:
        - [ ] Create a new `FantasyTeam_PoC` record with a unique `teamId`, the `leagueId`, current `userId`, a default `teamName`, and an empty `playerIds_onRoster`.
        - [ ] Add the new `teamId` to the `League_PoC.participatingTeamIds` array.
        - [ ] Save changes to both `FantasyTeam_PoC` and `League_PoC` records (ensure atomicity if possible).
    - [ ] Return a success response, perhaps with the details of the joined league or the new team.
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware (error handling, logging).
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - "Join League" UI & Logic (e.g., `app/(main)/league/join/page.tsx` or a modal)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** Use v0.io (or similar, by prompting it for a simple form page/modal) to generate the initial UI structure with an input field for "League ID" and a "Join League" button.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** Implement client-side form state management and basic validation (e.g., League ID format if known).
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.4:** Handle API call to the "Join League" endpoint on form submission, passing the League ID.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.5:** On success, redirect the user to the joined league's dashboard (e.g., `/league/[leagueId]/dashboard`) or provide a success message with a link.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.6:** Display success or error messages from the API.
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - Link/Button to Join League**
    - [ ] Add a "Join League" button or link to an appropriate location (e.g., user dashboard `app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` or a league listing page) that navigates to the "Join League" page/modal.
- [ ] **Task 4: Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for backend league joining logic (validations: existence, capacity, draft status, already joined).
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the frontend "Join League" form/modal component.
    - [ ] Write an integration test for the "Join League" API endpoint.
    - [ ] Write E2E tests for:
        - Successfully joining an open league.
        - Attempting to join a non-existent league.
        - Attempting to join a full league.
        - Attempting to join a league where the draft is in progress or completed.
        - Attempting to join a league the user is already in.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for `League_PoC` and `FantasyTeam_PoC` data models.
    - Database operations (creating `FantasyTeam_PoC` and updating `League_PoC`) should ideally be atomic to prevent inconsistencies if one part fails.
    - Ensure `teamId` for `FantasyTeam_PoC` is unique (e.g., UUID).
- **Frontend:**
    - The v0.io prompt for the "Join League" UI should be for a simple form.
    - Error handling and user feedback are important (e.g., "League full," "Invalid League ID," "Draft already started").
- **General:**
    - API endpoint needs core middleware and must be authenticated.
