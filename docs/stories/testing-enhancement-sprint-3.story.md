# Testing Enhancement Sprint 3: AI Integration Foundation

## Status: Not Started

## Epic: Testing Enhancement

## Story

As a development team, I want focused testing patterns added to Epic 4 user story (4.1) so that coding agents can implement robust tests without getting stuck in testing loops and AI integration features can be completed with comprehensive test coverage for intelligent draft assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria (5 Tasks)

1. **Research Phase**: Current 2025 testing best practices are researched for AI integration tech stack (LLM APIs, real-time AI suggestions, context management, prompt engineering).
2. **Pain Point Analysis**: Common coding agent testing pain points are identified and documented for AI integration challenges including API mocking, response validation, and context testing.
3. **Focused Testing Creation**: Comprehensive testing section (~100-150 lines) is created for Story 4.1 with practical TypeScript examples and 2025 AI testing best practices.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Changelog is updated for Story 4.1 with testing enhancement entry dated 2025-06-07.
5. **Quality Validation**: Updated story is validated for proper integration, formatting, and testing section placement before "Current Implementation References".
