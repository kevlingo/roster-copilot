# Story 1.8: Core Live Online Snake Draft Room Interface

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a logged-in user in an active league, I want to access a live online draft room that supports a snake draft format so that I can select players for my team in real-time with other league members.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  When a `League_PoC.draftStatus` is "Scheduled" or "InProgress", users participating in that league can navigate to and enter the "Live Draft Room" page (e.g., `app/(main)/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx`).
2.  The Draft Room displays a visual draft board showing all draft picks by team and round.
3.  The Draft Room clearly indicates the current team on the clock and the time remaining for their pick (PoC: pick timer 60-90 seconds, strict auto-pick enforcement out of scope for MVP).
4.  The Draft Room displays a list of available `NFLPlayer` records (from static data).
5.  The available player list is filterable by position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF).
6.  Available player information in the list includes at least `fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, and `projectedPoints` (using the `DraftPlayerCard.tsx` component from Story 5 of v0.io prompt, or similar).
7.  A user whose turn it is to pick can select an available player from the list and confirm their pick.
8.  Once a player is picked:
    * The player is removed from the available player list for the league.
    * The player is added to the drafting user's `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`.
    * The draft board is updated to reflect the pick.
9.  The draft proceeds in a snake order (e.g., Teams 1-N, N-1, 1-N).
10. Users can view their current team roster as it's being built within the Draft Room UI.
11. The system updates the draft board, current pick, available players, and team rosters in near real-time for all users in the Draft Room (PoC: Polling API for draft state updates is acceptable; WebSockets are a stretch goal).
12. When the draft is completed (all teams fill rosters per `League_PoC.rosterSettings`), the system indicates draft end.
13. The `League_PoC.draftStatus` is updated to "InProgress" when the draft starts (e.g., first pick or manual commissioner start – manual start is fine for PoC) and "Completed" when it ends.
14. PoC: Assumes all users are online; no auto-pick for absent users.
15. A designated area for the AI Copilot Co-Pilot panel (from Story 3.1 onwards) is present in the layout, but its functionality is not part of *this* story's ACs.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Draft State Management & API Endpoints**
    - [x] **Subtask 1.1:** Design/refine backend logic to manage the full draft state: draft order (snake), current pick, timer (if tracked server-side), players picked by each team, remaining available players for the league.
    - [x] **Subtask 1.2:** Create/Update API endpoint to get current draft status and details (`GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft`).
        - [x] Response should include: current picker, time remaining (if any), full draft board (picks made), user's current roster, and a list of currently available `NFLPlayer` IDs (frontend can then fetch details or these can be included).
    - [x] **Subtask 1.3:** Create API endpoint to make a draft pick (`POST /api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/pick`).
        - [x] Input: `playerId`.
        - [x] Validate: User's turn, player availability, valid player ID.
        - [x] Update `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`.
        - [x] Update overall draft state (mark player as picked, advance to next picker).
    - [x] **Subtask 1.4:** Implement logic to initialize the draft (set order, available players from league's universe of players – for PoC this is all `NFLPlayer` static data).
    - [x] **Subtask 1.5:** Implement logic to update `League_PoC.draftStatus`.
    - [x] Apply core API middleware.
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - Draft Room UI & Logic (`app/(main)/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx`)**
    - [x] **Subtask 2.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (section related to `/draft/:leagueId` page: "Key Elements: Draft board... available player list... AI Co-Pilot panel area.") to generate the initial UI structure for the Draft Room page.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.3:** Implement Draft Board UI: Grid display of picks, showing player name/team/position once picked.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.4:** Implement Available Player List UI:
        - [x] Use/adapt the `DraftPlayerCard.tsx` component (specified in v0.io prompt, Story 5) for displaying each player.
        - [x] Implement filters for player position.
        - [x] Implement action to select a player for drafting when it's the user's turn.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.5:** Implement "My Current Roster" display area.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.6:** Display current picker, round/pick number, and a simple timer (client-side timer acceptable for PoC visual).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.7:** Implement logic to fetch draft state periodically (polling `GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft`) and update all relevant UI sections.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.8:** When it's the user's turn, enable pick confirmation button. On click, call `POST /api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/pick`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.9:** Handle UI updates based on API responses (e.g., successful pick, error messages).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.10:** Ensure placeholder area for AI Co-Pilot Panel is integrated into the layout.
- [ ] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend draft logic (snake order, pick validation, state updates).
    - [ ] Unit tests for key frontend components (Player List, Draft Board display logic).
    - [ ] Integration tests for `GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft` and `POST /api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/pick` API endpoints.
    - [ ] E2E test for a user participating in a simplified draft: viewing draft board, filtering players, making a pick, seeing board/roster update.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Real-Time Communication & Performance (2025 Best Practices)**
- **Polling vs WebSocket Strategy**: Implement intelligent polling with dynamic intervals for optimal performance:
  ```typescript
  const useDraftPolling = (leagueId: string) => {
    const [interval, setInterval] = useState(3000); // 3s active, 30s background

    useEffect(() => {
      const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
        setInterval(document.hidden ? 30000 : 3000);
      };
      document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
      return () => document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
    }, []);
  };
  ```
- **Performance Optimization**: Use React hooks with memoization for efficient re-rendering:
  ```typescript
  const DraftBoard = memo(({ picks }: { picks: DraftPick[] }) => {
    const memoizedPicks = useMemo(() =>
      picks.map(pick => ({ ...pick, key: `${pick.round}-${pick.position}` })),
      [picks]
    );
    return <div>{/* Render optimized picks */}</div>;
  });
  ```
- **State Management**: Implement batched updates for high-frequency draft state changes
- **WebSocket Migration Path**: Design polling system to easily upgrade to WebSockets for 14-22x higher throughput

### **Snake Draft Algorithm & Database Concurrency**
- **Snake Draft Implementation**: Robust algorithm with TypeScript type safety:
  ```typescript
  class SnakeDraftEngine {
    generatePickOrder(teams: string[], rounds: number): DraftOrder[] {
      return Array.from({ length: rounds }, (_, round) =>
        round % 2 === 0 ? [...teams] : [...teams].reverse()
      ).flat().map((teamId, index) => ({
        pickNumber: index + 1,
        round: Math.floor(index / teams.length) + 1,
        teamId,
        position: (index % teams.length) + 1
      }));
    }
  }
  ```
- **Atomic Transaction Management**: SQLite WAL mode with immediate transactions for concurrency:
  ```typescript
  @Transactional()
  async executeDraftPick(pick: DraftPickRequest): Promise<DraftPickResult> {
    // BEGIN IMMEDIATE transaction
    await this.validatePickTurn(pick.teamId, pick.pickNumber);
    await this.validatePlayerAvailability(pick.playerId);
    await this.updatePlayerRoster(pick.teamId, pick.playerId);
    await this.advanceDraftState(pick.pickNumber);
    // COMMIT with optimistic concurrency control
  }
  ```
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implement optimistic locking with version control for draft state consistency
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient SQLite connection management for concurrent draft operations

### **Frontend State Management & User Experience**
- **React Hook Patterns**: Custom hooks for draft state with automatic polling and error recovery:
  ```typescript
  const useDraftState = (leagueId: string) => {
    const [state, setState] = useState<DraftState>();
    const [error, setError] = useState<Error>();

    const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
      queryKey: ['draft', leagueId],
      queryFn: () => fetchDraftState(leagueId),
      refetchInterval: 3000,
      onError: (err) => setError(err)
    });

    return { state: data, isLoading, error, refetch };
  };
  ```
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on conflict detection
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling for network failures and draft conflicts
- **Loading States**: Progressive enhancement with skeleton screens during state updates
- **Turn Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for user turn status and draft progression

### **Database Performance & Scalability**
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized indexes for frequent draft queries:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_draft_picks_league_round ON DraftPicks(leagueId, round, position);
  CREATE INDEX idx_players_available ON NFLPlayers(isAvailable, position);
  ```
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient draft state retrieval with minimal database hits
- **Connection Management**: SQLite WAL mode for concurrent read/write operations
- **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for frequently accessed draft data
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics for draft operation latency

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy (2025 Best Practices)

### **Testing Architecture for Draft Management**

**Purpose**: Provide research-backed testing patterns for real-time WebSocket updates, state synchronization, draft versioning, and concurrent user handling to prevent coding agents from common draft management testing loops.

#### **WebSocket Real-Time Testing (2025 Standards)**
```typescript
// Common Issue: WebSocket connection and message handling complexity
test('handles concurrent draft updates with conflict resolution', async () => {
  const mockServer = new MockWebSocketServer();
  const clientA = createWebSocketClient('userA');
  const clientB = createWebSocketClient('userB');

  // Both users edit same draft simultaneously
  clientA.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'DRAFT_UPDATE',
    draftId: 'draft123',
    content: 'Version A',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }));

  clientB.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'DRAFT_UPDATE',
    draftId: 'draft123',
    content: 'Version B',
    timestamp: Date.now() + 10
  }));

  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(100);

  // Last write wins conflict resolution
  expect(mockServer.getDraftState('draft123')).toMatchObject({
    content: 'Version B',
    version: 2,
    lastModifiedBy: 'userB'
  });
});

test('maintains WebSocket connection with heartbeat mechanism', async () => {
  const client = createWebSocketClient('user1');
  const heartbeatSpy = vi.fn();

  client.on('ping', heartbeatSpy);

  // Simulate 30 seconds of connection
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(30000);

  expect(heartbeatSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3); // Every 10 seconds
  expect(client.readyState).toBe(WebSocket.OPEN);
});
```

#### **State Synchronization Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: State drift between client and server
test('synchronizes draft state across multiple clients', async () => {
  const server = createMockDraftServer();
  const clients = [
    createWebSocketClient('user1'),
    createWebSocketClient('user2'),
    createWebSocketClient('user3')
  ];

  // User1 creates draft
  clients[0].send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'CREATE_DRAFT',
    title: 'Test Draft',
    content: 'Initial content'
  }));

  await vi.waitFor(() => {
    clients.forEach(client => {
      expect(client.lastMessage).toMatchObject({
        type: 'DRAFT_CREATED',
        draftId: expect.any(String)
      });
    });
  });
});

test('handles optimistic updates with server rollback', async () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useDraftStore());
  const mockWebSocket = createMockWebSocket();

  // Optimistic update
  await act(async () => {
    result.current.updateDraft('draft123', 'New content');
  });

  expect(result.current.drafts['draft123'].content).toBe('New content');
  expect(result.current.drafts['draft123'].isPending).toBe(true);

  // Server rejects update
  mockWebSocket.simulateMessage({
    type: 'UPDATE_REJECTED',
    draftId: 'draft123',
    reason: 'Validation failed'
  });

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(result.current.drafts['draft123'].content).toBe('Original content');
    expect(result.current.drafts['draft123'].isPending).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

#### **Draft Versioning & Conflict Resolution Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Version conflicts and merge strategies
test('implements operational transformation for concurrent edits', async () => {
  const draft = createDraft('Hello world');

  // Simulate two operations happening simultaneously
  const opA = { type: 'INSERT', position: 6, text: 'beautiful ' }; // "Hello beautiful world"
  const opB = { type: 'DELETE', position: 5, length: 6 }; // "Hello"

  const transformedOps = operationalTransform([opA, opB]);
  const finalContent = applyOperations(draft.content, transformedOps);

  expect(finalContent).toBe('Hello beautiful');
});

test('maintains draft history for rollback functionality', async () => {
  const draftId = 'history-test';
  const versions = [
    'Version 1',
    'Version 2 with changes',
    'Version 3 final'
  ];

  for (const content of versions) {
    await updateDraft(draftId, content);
  }

  const history = await getDraftHistory(draftId);
  expect(history).toHaveLength(3);

  // Rollback to version 1
  await rollbackDraft(draftId, history[0].versionId);
  const currentDraft = await getDraft(draftId);
  expect(currentDraft.content).toBe('Version 1');
});
```

#### **Performance & Load Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: WebSocket performance under load
test('handles high-frequency draft updates without message loss', async () => {
  const client = createWebSocketClient('heavy-user');
  const messagesSent = [];
  const messagesReceived = [];

  // Send 100 rapid updates
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    const message = {
      type: 'DRAFT_UPDATE',
      draftId: 'load-test',
      content: `Update ${i}`,
      sequence: i
    };
    messagesSent.push(message);
    client.send(JSON.stringify(message));
  }

  await vi.waitFor(() => {
    expect(messagesReceived).toHaveLength(100);
  }, { timeout: 5000 });

  // Verify no message loss and correct ordering
  messagesReceived.forEach((msg, index) => {
    expect(msg.sequence).toBe(index);
  });
});

test('implements backpressure handling for slow clients', async () => {
  const slowClient = createWebSocketClient('slow-client', {
    messageDelay: 1000
  });
  const server = createMockDraftServer();

  // Flood with messages
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    server.broadcast({
      type: 'DRAFT_UPDATE',
      content: `Broadcast ${i}`
    });
  }

  // Server should implement backpressure
  expect(server.getClientQueueSize('slow-client')).toBeLessThan(10);
  expect(server.lastResponse).toMatchObject({
    status: 429,
    message: 'Rate limit exceeded'
  });
});
```

#### **Security & Validation Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Input validation and XSS prevention
test('validates and sanitizes draft content', async () => {
  const maliciousContent = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>Hello';

  const result = await updateDraft('security-test', maliciousContent);

  expect(result.content).toBe('Hello'); // Script tags removed
  expect(result.content).not.toContain('<script>');
});

test('enforces authentication for draft operations', async () => {
  const unauthenticatedClient = createWebSocketClient(null); // No auth

  unauthenticatedClient.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'CREATE_DRAFT',
    title: 'Unauthorized Draft'
  }));

  await vi.waitFor(() => {
    expect(unauthenticatedClient.lastMessage).toMatchObject({
      type: 'ERROR',
      code: 'UNAUTHORIZED',
      message: 'Authentication required'
    });
  });
});

test('prevents draft access across user boundaries', async () => {
  const userA = createWebSocketClient('userA');
  const userB = createWebSocketClient('userB');

  // UserA creates private draft
  userA.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'CREATE_DRAFT',
    title: 'Private Draft',
    visibility: 'private'
  }));

  const draftId = await getDraftIdFromResponse(userA.lastMessage);

  // UserB tries to access UserA's private draft
  userB.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'GET_DRAFT',
    draftId: draftId
  }));

  await vi.waitFor(() => {
    expect(userB.lastMessage).toMatchObject({
      type: 'ERROR',
      code: 'FORBIDDEN',
      message: 'Access denied'
    });
  });
});
```

#### **End-to-End Draft Management Flow**
```typescript
// Playwright E2E testing
test('complete collaborative draft editing flow', async ({ page, context }) => {
  // Open two browser contexts for different users
  const userAPage = page;
  const userBPage = await context.newPage();

  // Both users login
  await loginUser(userAPage, 'userA@example.com', 'password');
  await loginUser(userBPage, 'userB@example.com', 'password');

  // UserA creates draft
  await userAPage.goto('/drafts/new');
  await userAPage.fill('[data-testid="draft-title"]', 'Collaborative Draft');
  await userAPage.fill('[data-testid="draft-content"]', 'Initial content');
  await userAPage.click('[data-testid="save-draft"]');

  const draftUrl = userAPage.url();
  const draftId = draftUrl.split('/').pop();

  // UserB joins the draft
  await userBPage.goto(`/drafts/${draftId}`);

  // Both users should see real-time updates
  await userAPage.fill('[data-testid="draft-content"]', 'UserA edit');
  await expect(userBPage.locator('[data-testid="draft-content"]')).toHaveValue('UserA edit');

  await userBPage.fill('[data-testid="draft-content"]', 'UserB edit');
  await expect(userAPage.locator('[data-testid="draft-content"]')).toHaveValue('UserB edit');
});
```

**Key Testing Patterns (2025 Standards):**

| Test Category | Focus | Common Pitfall | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------------|----------|
| WebSocket Connections | Message ordering, connection stability | Not testing reconnection scenarios | Use mock servers with connection drops |
| State Synchronization | Optimistic updates, rollback | Race conditions in state updates | Use vi.waitFor with proper timeouts |
| Conflict Resolution | Operational transformation, versioning | Not testing concurrent edits | Simulate simultaneous operations |
| Performance | High-frequency updates, backpressure | Memory leaks in long connections | Test with sustained load and cleanup |

**Essential Testing Focus:**
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Test WebSocket message ordering and state consistency
- **Conflict Resolution**: Verify operational transformation and merge strategies
- **Performance Under Load**: Validate backpressure handling and message queuing
- **Security Validation**: Test authentication, authorization, and input sanitization
