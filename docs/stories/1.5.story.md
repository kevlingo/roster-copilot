# Story 1.5: Forgot Password Functionality

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a registered user who has forgotten their password, I want to be able to securely reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A "Forgot Password?" link is available on the Login page (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`).
2.  Clicking the "Forgot Password?" link takes the user to a "Request Password Reset" page (e.g., `app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`) where they can enter their registered email address.
3.  Upon submitting a registered email address on the "Request Password Reset" page, the system generates a unique, time-limited, single-use password reset token (e.g., stored in `ResetToken_PoC` table as per `Architecture.md#ResetToken_PoC`).
4.  The system uses the "Resend" service to send a password reset email to the submitted email address, but only if that email address is found in the `UserProfile` records.
5.  The email clearly explains the purpose of the link/token and how to use it to reset the password. The link should lead to a "Reset Password" page including the token (e.g., `app/(auth)/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx`).
6.  The user is informed on-screen (on the "Request Password Reset" page) that if an account exists for the entered email, a password reset link has been sent (this avoids confirming whether an email is registered).
7.  Clicking the reset link/token in the email takes the user to the secure "Reset Password" page (`app/(auth)/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx`) where they can enter and confirm a new password. The token from the URL is used by this page.
8.  The new password must adhere to defined complexity rules (as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md`).
9.  Upon successful password reset (new password entered and confirmed on the "Reset Password" page):
    * The user's `UserProfile.passwordHash` is updated in the system with the new hashed password.
    * The password reset token (`ResetToken_PoC`) is marked as used or invalidated.
10. The user receives an on-screen confirmation of the successful password change on the "Reset Password" page and is prompted to log in with their new password (e.g., redirected to `/login`).
11. (Optional but good practice) The user receives an email notification (via Resend) that their password has been changed.
12. If the submitted email address on the "Request Password Reset" page is not found in the system, no email is sent, but the on-screen message remains generic (as per AC6).
13. If the reset link/token is invalid (e.g., not found, expired, already used) when accessing the "Reset Password" page, an appropriate error message is displayed to the user on that page.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile`, `ResetToken_PoC` data models, and `Resend API` usage.
    - Password reset tokens must be cryptographically secure, single-use, and have a short, configurable expiry (e.g., 1 hour).
    - Ensure the "Request Password Reset" flow does not confirm/deny email existence to prevent user enumeration attacks.
    - New passwords must be hashed using the same secure method as in Story 1.1.
- **Frontend:**
    - The v0.io prompt might need to be general for these simple form pages (e.g., "Create a page with a single email input and submit button, styled with DaisyUI/Tailwind").
    - Token handling from the URL in the "Reset Password" page needs to be secure.
- **General:**
    - API endpoints require core middleware. Password complexity rules from `docs/operational-guidelines.md` apply.
