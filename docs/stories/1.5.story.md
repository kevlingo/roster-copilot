# Story 1.5: Forgot Password Functionality

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a registered user who has forgotten their password, I want to be able to securely reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A "Forgot Password?" link is available on the Login page (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`).
2.  Clicking the "Forgot Password?" link takes the user to a "Request Password Reset" page (e.g., `app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`) where they can enter their registered email address.
3.  Upon submitting a registered email address on the "Request Password Reset" page, the system generates a unique, time-limited, single-use password reset token (e.g., stored in `ResetToken_PoC` table as per `Architecture.md#ResetToken_PoC`).
4.  The system uses the "Resend" service to send a password reset email to the submitted email address, but only if that email address is found in the `UserProfile` records.
5.  The email clearly explains the purpose of the link/token and how to use it to reset the password. The link should lead to a "Reset Password" page including the token (e.g., `app/(auth)/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx`).
6.  The user is informed on-screen (on the "Request Password Reset" page) that if an account exists for the entered email, a password reset link has been sent (this avoids confirming whether an email is registered).
7.  Clicking the reset link/token in the email takes the user to the secure "Reset Password" page (`app/(auth)/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx`) where they can enter and confirm a new password. The token from the URL is used by this page.
8.  The new password must adhere to defined complexity rules (as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md`).
9.  Upon successful password reset (new password entered and confirmed on the "Reset Password" page):
    * The user's `UserProfile.passwordHash` is updated in the system with the new hashed password.
    * The password reset token (`ResetToken_PoC`) is marked as used or invalidated.
10. The user receives an on-screen confirmation of the successful password change on the "Reset Password" page and is prompted to log in with their new password (e.g., redirected to `/login`).
11. (Optional but good practice) The user receives an email notification (via Resend) that their password has been changed.
12. If the submitted email address on the "Request Password Reset" page is not found in the system, no email is sent, but the on-screen message remains generic (as per AC6).
13. If the reset link/token is invalid (e.g., not found, expired, already used) when accessing the "Reset Password" page, an appropriate error message is displayed to the user on that page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Request Password Reset API Endpoint (`/api/auth/forgot-password`)**
    - [ ] Create API Route Handler at `app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`.
    - [ ] Implement input DTO validation (email).
    - [ ] Check if email exists in `UserProfile`.
    - [ ] If email exists, generate unique reset token, store in `ResetToken_PoC` with expiry.
    - [ ] Trigger password reset email via Notification Service (Resend), including the token in the reset link.
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware (error handling, logging).
- [ ] **Task 2: Backend - Reset Password API Endpoint (`/api/auth/reset-password`)**
    - [ ] Create API Route Handler at `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`.
    - [ ] Implement input DTO validation (token, newPassword, confirmNewPassword).
    - [ ] Validate reset token (exists in `ResetToken_PoC`, not expired, not used).
    - [ ] Validate new password complexity.
    - [ ] Hash new password.
    - [ ] Update `UserProfile.passwordHash` for the user associated with the token.
    - [ ] Invalidate reset token.
    - [ ] (Optional) Trigger "password changed" notification email via Resend.
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware.
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - "Request Password Reset" Page (`app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.1:** Use v0.io (or similar, by prompting it for a simple form page) to generate the initial UI structure for a page with an email input field and a "Send Reset Link" button.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.3:** Implement client-side form state and validation.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.4:** Handle API call to `/api/auth/forgot-password`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.5:** Display generic "email sent if account exists" confirmation message or API errors.
- [ ] **Task 4: Frontend - "Reset Password" Page (`app/(auth)/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 4.1:** Use v0.io (or similar, by prompting it for a simple form page) to generate the initial UI structure for a page with "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields and a "Reset Password" button.
    - [ ] **Subtask 4.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 4.3:** Implement logic to capture the reset token from the URL.
    - [ ] **Subtask 4.4:** Implement client-side form state and validation (including password match and complexity).
    - [ ] **Subtask 4.5:** Handle API call to `/api/auth/reset-password` with token and new passwords.
    - [ ] **Subtask 4.6:** Display success message and redirect to login, or display API/token validation errors.
- [ ] **Task 5: Frontend - Link on Login Page**
    - [ ] Add "Forgot Password?" link on the Login page UI (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`) pointing to `/forgot-password`.
- [ ] **Task 6: Email Templates**
    - [ ] Design and implement HTML email template for the password reset link (sent via Resend).
    - [ ] (Optional) Design and implement HTML email template for password changed notification (sent via Resend).
- [ ] **Task 7: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend token generation, password reset logic, email sending.
    - [ ] Unit tests for frontend form components.
    - [ ] Integration tests for `/api/auth/forgot-password` and `/api/auth/reset-password` API endpoints.
    - [ ] E2E test for the full forgot password flow: requesting reset, clicking email link, submitting new password, logging in with new password. Test invalid/expired token scenarios.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile`, `ResetToken_PoC` data models, and `Resend API` usage.
    - Password reset tokens must be cryptographically secure, single-use, and have a short, configurable expiry (e.g., 1 hour).
    - Ensure the "Request Password Reset" flow does not confirm/deny email existence to prevent user enumeration attacks.
    - New passwords must be hashed using the same secure method as in Story 1.1.
- **Frontend:**
    - The v0.io prompt might need to be general for these simple form pages (e.g., "Create a page with a single email input and submit button, styled with DaisyUI/Tailwind").
    - Token handling from the URL in the "Reset Password" page needs to be secure.
- **General:**
    - API endpoints require core middleware. Password complexity rules from `docs/operational-guidelines.md` apply.
