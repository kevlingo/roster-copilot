# Story 3.2: Provide Contextual Draft Guidance for Eager Learners

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 3 - AI-Powered Draft Assistance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As a user identified as an "Eager Learner" for **Roster Copilot**, I want to receive contextual guidance and tips from the AI Copilot (Draft Day Co-Pilot) throughout the live draft process so that I can better understand draft procedures and basic strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  If the user's `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` is "Eager Learner", the AI Copilot panel (within the Draft Room UI from Story 1.8) provides additional contextual help during the draft.
2.  This guidance is triggered by specific draft events or states. For PoC, these triggers include:
    * At the beginning of the draft.
    * Before the user's first pick.
    * Periodically (e.g., every few rounds) with general strategy tips.
    * When common draft concepts are relevant (e.g., explaining "snake draft" briefly).
3.  Guidance and tips are concise, easy to understand, use simple language, and are directly relevant to the current stage or context of the draft.
4.  Examples of guidance content for PoC:
    * "Welcome to your **Roster Copilot** draft! Remember, the pick order reverses each round in a snake draft."
    * "It's your first pick! Don't worry, the AI Copilot is here to help. Consider looking for a strong player at a key position like Running Back or Wide Receiver."
    * "As the draft progresses, pay attention to building a balanced roster across all positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF)."
    * "Don't forget about bye weeks! Try not to draft too many key players who have the same bye week." (Requires `NFLPlayer` data to have accessible bye week info for PoC).
5.  This guidance is displayed within the AI Copilot panel/area in the Draft Room UI, clearly distinguished from specific player recommendations (from Story 3.1).
6.  The guidance is designed to be helpful and educational, not overwhelming, for new users.
7.  The "AI Mentor Service" (now to be considered "AI Copilot Service" internally for Roster Copilot) is responsible for identifying the "Eager Learner" profile and triggering/generating this contextual guidance based on the draft state.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend ("AI Copilot Service") - Contextual Guidance Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Implement logic within the "AI Copilot Service" to identify if the current user's profile is "Eager Learner".
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** Create or refine a library of contextual draft tips and guidance messages, ensuring they refer to "Roster Copilot" where appropriate.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.3:** Implement logic to determine when to provide specific tips based on draft state (current round, user's pick number, first-time event flags).
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.4:** Ensure the API endpoint used for draft advice (e.g., `/api/copilot/draft-advice` from Story 3.1, path may need updating to reflect "copilot") can also carry these contextual guidance messages if applicable for the user.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - Display Contextual Guidance in AI Copilot Panel (Draft Room)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** In the Draft Room UI (`app/(main)/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx`), ensure the AI Copilot panel area can display these contextual guidance messages.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** Implement logic to render these messages if they are present in the API response and the user is an "Eager Learner".
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** Ensure guidance messages are styled distinctly from player recommendations to avoid confusion.
- [ ] **Task 3: Content Finalization**
    - [ ] Review and finalize the set of PoC contextual draft tips and guidance messages for "Eager Learner" users, updating any "Mentor" references to "Copilot."
- [ ] **Task 4: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for the backend logic that triggers and selects guidance messages.
    - [ ] Unit tests for the frontend component section displaying guidance.
    - [ ] E2E test: A user with an "Eager Learner" profile enters the draft; verify that contextual tips appear at appropriate times in the AI Copilot panel and reference "Roster Copilot."

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend ("AI Copilot Service"):**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` and the role of the (now effectively named) "AI Copilot Service".
    - The backend will need to track draft progress (current round, pick) to trigger relevant tips.
- **Frontend:**
    - The UI for guidance should be integrated within the AI Copilot panel as conceptualized in `UIUX_Spec.md` and potentially scaffolded by v0.io for the Draft Room.
    - Ensure a clear visual distinction between general guidance and player-specific recommendations.
- **Content:** All user-facing text, including these tips, should now reflect the "Roster Copilot" branding.
