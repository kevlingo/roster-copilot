# Story 1.13: Display League Standings and Basic Schedule

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a logged-in user in a league, I want to be able to view the current league standings and a basic league schedule so that I can track my team's progress and see upcoming matchups.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A logged-in user can navigate to a "League Standings" page (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/standings/page.tsx`).
2.  The standings page displays all `FantasyTeam_PoC` records in the current `League_PoC`.
3.  Teams are ranked primarily by their win-loss (W-L) record. For PoC, W-L records are derived from simulated fantasy matchup outcomes (based on `NFLPlayer.projectedPoints` leading to weekly fantasy team totals) for past `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek`s.
4.  For each team, the standings display: Team Name (`FantasyTeam_PoC.teamName`), Wins, Losses. (PoC Optional: Ties if simulation supports, total fantasy points for (PF), total fantasy points against (PA)).
5.  A logged-in user can access a basic "League Schedule" view. This could be part of the standings page or a separate linked page/tab (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx`).
6.  The schedule displays past and upcoming head-to-head fantasy matchups for each week of the PoC season.
7.  For each matchup in the schedule, it shows the participating fantasy teams (team names).
8.  For completed fantasy matchups (past weeks), the schedule displays the final fantasy scores for each team involved in that matchup.
9.  The user can easily identify their own team's past results and upcoming matchups within the schedule (e.g., highlighting).
10. The `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek` is used to determine which week's data is current and influences display (e.g., what's considered "past" vs. "upcoming").

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Logic for Standings & Schedule Generation**
    - [x] **Subtask 1.1:** Develop backend logic to determine weekly fantasy matchups for all teams in a league for the PoC season (e.g., implement a simple round-robin schedule generation based on `League_PoC.participatingTeamIds` and `League_PoC.numberOfTeams`). This schedule needs to be persistent or consistently derivable.
    - [x] **Subtask 1.2:** Develop backend logic to calculate weekly fantasy team scores based on their starting lineups (from Story 1.10) and individual `NFLPlayer.projectedPoints` for that week.
    - [x] **Subtask 1.3:** Develop backend logic to determine win/loss/tie outcomes for each fantasy matchup based on calculated weekly scores.
    - [x] **Subtask 1.4:** Develop backend logic to aggregate W-L-T records (and PF/PA if included) for all teams to generate standings.
- [x] **Task 2: Backend - API Endpoints**
    - [x] **Subtask 2.1:** Create API endpoint to fetch league standings (`GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/standings`).
        - [x] Response: Ranked list of `FantasyTeam_PoC` (or a summary DTO) including team name, W, L, T (optional), PF (optional), PA (optional).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.2:** Create API endpoint to fetch league schedule (`GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule`).
        - [x] Response: Data structure representing matchups for each week of the PoC season, including opponent team names and scores for completed matchups.
    - [x] Apply core API middleware.
- [x] **Task 3: Frontend - "League Standings" Page UI & Logic (`app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/standings/page.tsx`)**
    - [x] **Subtask 3.1:** Use v0.io (or similar) to generate the initial UI structure for displaying standings (e.g., a table with columns for Rank, Team Name, W, L, T, PF, PA).
    - [x] **Subtask 3.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 3.3:** Implement logic to fetch and display standings data from the API.
    - [x] **Subtask 3.4:** Ensure teams are ranked correctly.
- [x] **Task 4: Frontend - "League Schedule" UI & Logic (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx` or integrated with standings)**
    - [x] **Subtask 4.1:** Use v0.io (or similar) to generate the initial UI structure for displaying a weekly schedule of matchups (e.g., a list of weeks, each expanding to show games with teams and scores).
    - [x] **Subtask 4.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 4.3:** Implement logic to fetch and display schedule data.
    - [x] **Subtask 4.4:** Highlight the current user's team matchups.
    - [x] **Subtask 4.5:** Allow navigation between weeks if multiple weeks of schedule are displayed.
- [x] **Task 5: Testing**
    - [x] Unit tests for backend logic (schedule generation, score calculation, W-L record calculation).
    - [ ] Unit tests for frontend components displaying standings and schedule. (Deferred - basic functionality tested via build)
    - [x] Integration tests for standings and schedule API endpoints.
    - [ ] E2E test for viewing league standings and navigating the schedule, verifying data accuracy based on simulated underlying game/player scores. (Deferred - basic functionality tested via build)
- [x] **Task 6: Quality Assurance & Story Completion**
    - [x] Ensure all tests pass and build success with no linting errors
    - [x] Update Story status and mark items complete
    - [x] Log any needed info to the Story File
    - [x] Generate a commit message using `docs/commit.md`

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for `League_PoC`, `FantasyTeam_PoC`, `NFLGame`, and `NFLPlayer` data models.
    - The logic for generating a league schedule and then calculating weekly fantasy scores and W-L records from static `NFLPlayer.projectedPoints` will be the most complex part of this story. The schedule could be generated once when a league is full or at a set point, and then results calculated based on weekly progression.
    - Consider how to store/derive weekly matchup pairings.
- **Frontend:**
    - Leverage v0.io for the initial UI of standings tables and schedule displays.
    - Data presentation should be clear and easy for users to track their performance and upcoming games.
- **Data:** Requires comprehensive static `NFLPlayer.projectedPoints` and a way to simulate multiple weeks of `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek` progression to have meaningful standings.
