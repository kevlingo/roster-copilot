# Story 3.4 (Stretch Goal): Request Alternative Draft Suggestion

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 3 - AI-Powered Draft Assistance MVP (Roster Copilot)

## Story

- As a user in a live draft for **Roster Copilot**, when the AI Copilot (Draft Day Co-Pilot) provides a player recommendation, I want to be able to easily request an alternative suggestion so that I can explore more options if the initial one isn't to my liking.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  When the AI Copilot panel displays player recommendations (as per Story 3.1), an option (e.g., a button labeled "Suggest Another" or "Alternative?") is available alongside or within the recommendation display.
2.  Clicking this option prompts the "AI Copilot Service" to generate a different player recommendation for the current pick.
3.  The alternative suggestion is distinct from the previously shown recommendation(s) for that pick turn, offering a genuinely different option (e.g., different player, perhaps different position if appropriate and logic supports).
4.  The alternative suggestion is displayed with the same level of context and preference-driven explanation as the initial recommendation (player info, rationale, as per Story 3.1 and Story 4.5).
5.  (PoC Scope) The AI Copilot Service offers a limited number of distinct alternatives (e.g., 1 or 2) per pick turn. After these, the "Suggest Another" button might be disabled or indicate no further alternatives are available for this turn.
6.  Requesting an alternative does not prevent the user from picking their original choice, the new alternative, or any other player independently (as per Story 3.3).
7.  The feature is simple and quick to use during a timed draft pick.
8.  This feature is explicitly identified as a "PoC Stretch Goal" in the `Prd.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend ("AI Copilot Service") - Alternative Recommendation Logic**
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Enhance the "AI Copilot Service's" draft recommendation logic to accept a parameter indicating a request for an alternative.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.2:** The service must maintain context of previously suggested players for the current user's turn to avoid immediate repetition.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.3:** Implement logic to generate a distinct alternative recommendation based on available players, user profile, and draft state. For PoC, this might involve having a small ranked list of suggestions per turn and cycling through them.
    - [ ] **Subtask 1.4:** Update the draft advice API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/copilot/draft-advice` from Story 3.1) to handle requests for alternatives (e.g., via a flag or parameter in the request payload, and potentially receiving a list of already suggested players to exclude).
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - UI for Requesting & Displaying Alternatives (AI Copilot Panel)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** Add a "Suggest Another" (or similar) button/UI element to the AI Copilot panel in the Draft Room (`app/(main)/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx`) when recommendations are displayed.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** When this button is clicked, call the draft advice API with the parameter indicating an alternative is requested (and any other necessary context like previously suggested players).
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** Update the AI Copilot panel to display the new alternative recommendation and its explanation.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.4:** Implement UI state to handle limiting the number of alternatives (e.g., disabling the button after 1-2 attempts per pick turn).
- [ ] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for the alternative recommendation logic in the "AI Copilot Service."
    - [ ] Update integration tests for the draft advice API endpoint to verify it returns alternative suggestions correctly.
    - [ ] E2E test: During a draft, user receives a recommendation, clicks "Suggest Another," and the AI Copilot panel updates with a new, different recommendation. Test the limit on alternatives.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend ("AI Copilot Service"):**
    - The main challenge is generating *genuinely different yet still valuable* alternative recommendations for the PoC. This might involve the service pre-calculating a short list (e.g., top 3) suggestions per turn and revealing them one by one.
    - The API might need to be stateful for the duration of a user's pick turn to "remember" what was already suggested, or the frontend might pass back the list of already seen suggestions for that turn.
- **Frontend:**
    - The UI for requesting an alternative should be simple and not clutter the AI Copilot panel excessively.
- **Stretch Goal Nature:** Remind the Dev Agent that this is a stretch goal. Focus on robust implementation of core draft features first. If time permits, this adds a nice polish.
