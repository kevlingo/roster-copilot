# Story 1.10: Set Weekly Lineup

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a logged-in user who is part of a league, I want to be able to set my weekly lineup for my fantasy team so that I can optimize my team's performance for the current week's games.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A logged-in user can navigate to a "Set Lineup" or "Manage Lineup" page for their team for the current/upcoming `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek` (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/lineup/page.tsx`).
2.  The page displays the user's current `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`, clearly distinguishing players in the starting lineup versus those on the bench for the selected week.
3.  The UI clearly shows the required number of players for each starting position (e.g., QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF) and available bench slots, based on `League_PoC.rosterSettings`.
4.  Users can move players between their bench and the starting lineup slots, adhering to positional requirements.
5.  The system prevents users from saving an invalid lineup. Invalid lineups include:
    * Incorrect number of players at any starting position (too many or too few, unless a slot can be legitimately empty by league rules - PoC assumes all starting slots must be filled).
    * An "Injured_Out" player (`NFLPlayer.status`) in a starting slot.
    * A player on a "Bye Week" (`NFLPlayer.status` or derived from `NFLGame` data for the current week) in a starting slot.
6.  Users can save their submitted lineup for the current/upcoming `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek`.
7.  The saved lineup for the specific week is persisted. (This might involve updating `FantasyTeam_PoC` with a structure like `weeklyLineups: { week: number; starters: string[]; }[];` or a new `WeeklyLineup_PoC` data model as discussed in `Architecture.md` data models).
8.  The saved lineup is reflected in other relevant views (e.g., the Roster page - Story 1.9, weekly matchup displays - Story 1.12).
9.  Player information on the "Set Lineup" page includes details relevant to decisions: `fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, `status`, `projectedPoints`, and their NFL game/opponent for the week (from static `NFLPlayer` & `NFLGame` data).
10. A "Save Lineup" action provides clear confirmation feedback (e.g., "Lineup saved successfully!").

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Data Model for Weekly Lineups**
    - [ ] Finalize the data model for storing weekly lineups (e.g., as an array within `FantasyTeam_PoC` or a separate `WeeklyLineups` table/collection), as per `Architecture.md` considerations.
    - [ ] Update database schema and DAL (Data Access Layer) accordingly if a new table is introduced or `FantasyTeam_PoC` is modified.
- [ ] **Task 2: Backend - API Endpoints for Lineups**
    - [ ] Create API endpoint to get the current lineup for a team for a specific week (`GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/my-team/lineup?week=[weekNumber]`).
        - [ ] Retrieve persisted lineup; if none exists for the week, return current roster with players designated as bench or a default valid lineup.
    - [ ] Create API endpoint to save/update the lineup for a team for a specific week (`POST` or `PUT /api/leagues/[leagueId]/my-team/lineup`).
        - [ ] Input: List of player IDs for starting positions and bench for the specified week.
        - [ ] Validate submitted lineup against `League_PoC.rosterSettings`, `NFLPlayer.status` (injuries, bye weeks).
        - [ ] Persist the valid lineup according to the chosen data model.
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware.
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - "Set Lineup" Page UI & Logic (`app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/lineup/page.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (section related to `/league/:leagueId/lineup` page: "Key Elements: Display of current roster, distinction between starters and bench, drag-and-drop or click-to-move interface...") to generate the initial UI structure.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.3:** Implement UI to display roster divided into starting slots (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF) and bench. Clearly show slot requirements (e.g., WR 0/2).
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.4:** Implement intuitive drag-and-drop or click-to-move functionality for assigning players to lineup slots or bench.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.5:** Display relevant player details (`status`, opponent, `projectedPoints`) to aid decisions.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.6:** Implement client-side validation to prevent obviously invalid moves (e.g., putting a QB in an RB slot, exceeding positional limits) and provide immediate feedback.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.7:** Handle API calls to fetch the current lineup (if any) and to save the new lineup.
    - [ ] **Subtask 3.8:** Display success/error messages from the API.
- [ ] **Task 4: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend lineup validation logic.
    - [ ] Unit tests for frontend lineup setting UI (drag/drop logic, client-side validation).
    - [ ] Integration tests for lineup fetching and saving API endpoints.
    - [ ] E2E test for: loading the lineup page, moving players between starters/bench, saving a valid lineup, attempting to save an invalid lineup and seeing errors.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - Refer to `Architecture.md` for relevant data models (`League_PoC`, `FantasyTeam_PoC`, `NFLPlayer`, `NFLGame`).
    - The choice of lineup storage (embedded in `FantasyTeam_PoC` vs. separate table) will impact query complexity. For PoC, embedding the current week's lineup might be simpler if only one active lineup is critical.
    - Backend validation is crucial for lineup integrity.
- **Frontend:**
    - Leverage the v0.io prompt for the initial UI. Drag-and-drop can be complex; a simpler click-to-move/assign system is an acceptable fallback for PoC if drag-and-drop proves too time-consuming. Libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd` or `dnd-kit` could be considered if drag-and-drop is pursued.
    - Provide clear visual cues for valid/invalid player placements and lineup status.
- **Data:** Ensure `NFLPlayer` static data includes varied statuses (Active, Injured_Out, Bye Week) and `NFLGame` data is sufficient to determine opponents and bye weeks.
