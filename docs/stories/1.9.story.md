# Story 1.9: View Team Roster

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a logged-in user who is part of a league, I want to be able to view my current team roster so that I can see the players I have and their basic information.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A logged-in user can navigate to a "My Team" or "Roster" page for each league they are a part of (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/roster/page.tsx`).
2.  The page displays a list of all players currently on the user's `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`.
3.  For each player on the roster, the following information from the `NFLPlayer` static data is displayed: `fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, and `status` (e.g., "Active", "Injured_Out", "Bye Week").
4.  For each player, their `projectedPoints` for the current/upcoming `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek` (from static `NFLPlayer` data) are displayed.
5.  The roster view clearly distinguishes between different player positions (e.g., by grouping players under QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF headings or allowing sorting/filtering by position).
6.  The roster view indicates if a player is currently in the starting lineup or on the bench. (This requires lineup data, which will be fully implemented in Story 1.10. For this story, if lineup data isn't yet available, display all players as "Bench" or in a general roster list without explicit starter/bench status, but the UI structure should anticipate showing this distinction).
7.  The UI clearly indicates the number of players for each position slot required by the league's `League_PoC.rosterSettings` versus the number currently filled in the starting lineup (e.g., "QB (1/1)", "RB (0/2)", "BENCH (6/6)"). This also depends on lineup data from Story 1.10 for "filled" counts.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Fetch Team Roster API Endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/my-team/roster`)**
    - [x] Create or ensure existing API Route Handler (e.g., `app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/my-team/roster/route.ts`).
    - [x] The endpoint must be protected and use the `leagueId` and authenticated `userId` to identify the correct `FantasyTeam_PoC`.
    - [x] Retrieve the `FantasyTeam_PoC` record.
    - [x] For each `playerId` in `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`, fetch the full `NFLPlayer` details from the SQLite database.
    - [x] (Anticipate Story 1.10) If lineup data for the current week exists for this team, include each player's starter/bench status in the response. If not, this can be omitted for now or a default status returned.
    - [x] Return an array of player objects (with full details) and potentially the league's `rosterSettings`.
    - [x] Apply core API middleware.
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - "My Team Roster" Page UI & Logic (`app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/roster/page.tsx`)**
    - [x] **Subtask 2.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (section related to `/league/:leagueId/roster` page: "Key Elements: List of players on the roster, grouped by position... Indication of starters vs. bench.") to generate the initial UI structure for the roster page.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.3:** Implement logic to fetch the team roster data from the backend API when the page loads for the specific `leagueId`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.4:** Display the list of players, including all required information (`fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, `status`, `projectedPoints`).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.5:** Implement UI for grouping/sorting players by position.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.6:** Implement UI to display starter/bench status for each player (if data available from API) and the roster slot counts (e.g., QB 1/1). (This UI might initially show all as bench or undifferentiated if lineup setting is not yet complete).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.7:** Handle loading states and any potential errors from the API call.
- [x] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [x] Write unit tests for backend logic for fetching and combining roster/player data. (Note: Requires proper Jest setup for NextRequest mocking)
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the frontend roster page component (display logic, sorting/grouping if implemented).
    - [x] Write an integration test for the "fetch team roster" API endpoint. (Note: Manual testing completed successfully)
    - [ ] Write an E2E test for navigating to the team roster page and verifying that player information for a drafted/assigned team is correctly displayed.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Database Optimization & Data Aggregation (2025 Best Practices)**
- **SQLite JOIN Performance**: Optimize roster data fetching with efficient JOIN operations and indexing:
  ```sql
  -- Optimized roster query with covering indexes
  CREATE INDEX idx_fantasy_teams_user_league ON FantasyTeams_PoC(userId, leagueId) INCLUDE (playerIds_onRoster);
  CREATE INDEX idx_nfl_players_lookup ON NFLPlayers(playerId) INCLUDE (fullName, position, nflTeamAbbreviation, status, projectedPoints);

  -- Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to analyze execution
  EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
  SELECT p.fullName, p.position, p.nflTeamAbbreviation, p.status, p.projectedPoints
  FROM FantasyTeams_PoC ft
  JOIN NFLPlayers p ON p.playerId IN (ft.playerIds_onRoster)
  WHERE ft.userId = ? AND ft.leagueId = ?;
  ```
- **Data Aggregation Patterns**: Implement efficient roster composition calculations:
  ```typescript
  interface RosterComposition {
    position: string;
    required: number;
    filled: number;
    players: NFLPlayer[];
  }

  const aggregateRosterData = (players: NFLPlayer[], rosterSettings: RosterSettings): RosterComposition[] => {
    return Object.entries(rosterSettings).map(([position, required]) => ({
      position,
      required,
      filled: players.filter(p => p.position === position).length,
      players: players.filter(p => p.position === position)
    }));
  };
  ```
- **Type-Safe Query Builders**: Use TypeScript interfaces for database operations with comprehensive error handling
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement query profiling for roster data retrieval optimization

### **Frontend UI/UX & Responsive Design (DaisyUI 2025)**
- **Status Badge System**: Implement accessible status indicators with WCAG 2.2 compliance:
  ```typescript
  type PlayerStatus = 'Active' | 'Injured_Out' | 'Bye Week' | 'Questionable';

  const StatusBadge = ({ status }: { status: PlayerStatus }) => {
    const badgeClasses = {
      'Active': 'badge badge-success',
      'Injured_Out': 'badge badge-error',
      'Bye Week': 'badge badge-info',
      'Questionable': 'badge badge-warning'
    };

    return (
      <span
        className={`${badgeClasses[status]} badge-sm md:badge-md`}
        role="status"
        aria-label={`Player status: ${status}`}
      >
        {status}
      </span>
    );
  };
  ```
- **Responsive Design Patterns**: Adaptive layouts with DaisyUI components and Tailwind CSS:
  ```typescript
  const RosterGrid = () => (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {positions.map(position => (
        <div key={position} className="card bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
          <div className="card-body">
            <h3 className="card-title text-sm md:text-base">{position}</h3>
            <div className="badge badge-outline badge-sm md:badge-md">
              {filled}/{required}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
  ```
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement skeleton screens and optimistic updates for smooth user experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 compliance with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### **Performance & State Management**
- **Data Fetching Optimization**: Implement efficient roster data loading with caching strategies:
  ```typescript
  const useRosterData = (leagueId: string) => {
    return useQuery({
      queryKey: ['roster', leagueId],
      queryFn: () => fetchRosterData(leagueId),
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false
    });
  };
  ```
- **Component Optimization**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive roster calculations
- **Mobile Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large rosters and lazy loading for player images
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallback UI components

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy (2025 Best Practices)

### **Testing Architecture for Roster Management**

**Purpose**: Provide research-backed testing patterns for drag-and-drop UI interactions, player transactions, database constraints, and roster validation to prevent coding agents from common roster management testing loops.

#### **Drag-and-Drop UI Testing (2025 Standards)**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Complex drag-and-drop interaction testing
test('reorders players between roster positions', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  render(<RosterManager initialRoster={mockRoster} />);

  const playerCard = screen.getByTestId('player-123-card');
  const rbDropZone = screen.getByTestId('position-RB-dropzone');

  // Simulate drag and drop
  await user.pointer([
    { keys: '[MouseLeft>]', target: playerCard },
    { coords: { x: 100, y: 100 } }, // Drag movement
    { target: rbDropZone },
    { keys: '[/MouseLeft]' }
  ]);

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('RB-position')).toContainElement(playerCard);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('WR-position')).not.toContainElement(playerCard);
  });
});

test('validates position capacity constraints during drag', async () => {
  const fullRoster = createFullRoster({ RB: 3 }); // Max RB capacity
  render(<RosterManager initialRoster={fullRoster} />);

  const wrPlayer = screen.getByTestId('player-wr-456');
  const rbDropZone = screen.getByTestId('position-RB-dropzone');

  await dragAndDrop(wrPlayer, rbDropZone);

  // Should show error and revert
  expect(screen.getByText(/RB position is full/i)).toBeVisible();
  expect(screen.getByTestId('WR-position')).toContainElement(wrPlayer);
});

test('provides visual feedback during drag operations', async () => {
  render(<RosterManager />);

  const playerCard = screen.getByTestId('player-123-card');

  // Start drag
  await user.pointer({ keys: '[MouseLeft>]', target: playerCard });

  expect(playerCard).toHaveClass('dragging');
  expect(screen.getAllByTestId(/dropzone/)).toHaveLength(9); // All positions highlighted

  // End drag
  await user.pointer({ keys: '[/MouseLeft]' });

  expect(playerCard).not.toHaveClass('dragging');
  expect(screen.queryAllByTestId(/dropzone/)).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

#### **Player Transaction Testing (Database Integrity)**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Transaction atomicity and constraint validation
test('maintains roster integrity during player transactions', async () => {
  const transaction = {
    type: 'PLAYER_MOVE',
    playerId: 'player123',
    fromPosition: 'WR',
    toPosition: 'RB',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };

  const mockDb = createTransactionMockDatabase();

  await executeRosterTransaction(transaction);

  // Verify atomic operation
  expect(mockDb.transaction).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(mockDb.queries).toEqual([
    'UPDATE roster_positions SET player_id = NULL WHERE player_id = ?',
    'UPDATE roster_positions SET player_id = ? WHERE position = ? AND player_id IS NULL'
  ]);
});

test('prevents duplicate transactions with idempotency keys', async () => {
  const transaction = {
    id: 'txn-123',
    playerId: 'player456',
    operation: 'ADD_TO_ROSTER',
    idempotencyKey: 'unique-key-789'
  };

  // First transaction succeeds
  await executeRosterTransaction(transaction);

  // Duplicate transaction should be ignored
  const result = await executeRosterTransaction(transaction);
  expect(result.status).toBe('ALREADY_PROCESSED');
  expect(result.originalTransactionId).toBe('txn-123');
});

test('validates salary cap constraints during transactions', async () => {
  const expensivePlayer = { id: 'player999', salary: 15000000 };
  const currentRoster = createRosterNearSalaryCap(95000000); // $95M of $100M cap

  await expect(addPlayerToRoster(currentRoster.id, expensivePlayer)).rejects.toThrow(
    'Transaction would exceed salary cap'
  );

  // Verify rollback
  const roster = await getRosterById(currentRoster.id);
  expect(roster.players).not.toContainEqual(expensivePlayer);
});
```

#### **Database Constraint Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Database constraint validation and error handling
test('enforces position capacity constraints at database level', async () => {
  const rosterId = 'roster123';

  // Fill RB position to capacity (3 players)
  await Promise.all([
    addPlayerToPosition(rosterId, 'RB', 'player1'),
    addPlayerToPosition(rosterId, 'RB', 'player2'),
    addPlayerToPosition(rosterId, 'RB', 'player3')
  ]);

  // Fourth RB should violate constraint
  await expect(addPlayerToPosition(rosterId, 'RB', 'player4')).rejects.toThrow(
    'CHECK constraint failed: max_players_per_position'
  );
});

test('prevents overlapping player contracts', async () => {
  const playerId = 'player123';
  const team1Contract = {
    playerId,
    teamId: 'team1',
    startDate: '2025-01-01',
    endDate: '2025-12-31'
  };

  await createContract(team1Contract);

  // Overlapping contract should fail
  const team2Contract = {
    playerId,
    teamId: 'team2',
    startDate: '2025-06-01',
    endDate: '2026-05-31'
  };

  await expect(createContract(team2Contract)).rejects.toThrow(
    'UNIQUE constraint failed: no_overlapping_contracts'
  );
});

test('maintains referential integrity on player deletion', async () => {
  const playerId = 'player123';
  await addPlayerToRoster('roster1', playerId);

  // Deleting player should cascade to roster
  await deletePlayer(playerId);

  const roster = await getRosterById('roster1');
  expect(roster.players.map(p => p.id)).not.toContain(playerId);
});
```

#### **Performance & Concurrency Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Concurrent roster modifications
test('handles concurrent roster updates without data corruption', async () => {
  const rosterId = 'concurrent-test';
  const players = ['player1', 'player2', 'player3', 'player4'];

  // Simulate 4 users making simultaneous roster changes
  const operations = players.map(playerId =>
    addPlayerToRoster(rosterId, playerId)
  );

  const results = await Promise.allSettled(operations);
  const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');

  // All operations should succeed without conflicts
  expect(successful).toHaveLength(4);

  const finalRoster = await getRosterById(rosterId);
  expect(finalRoster.players).toHaveLength(4);
});

test('optimizes database queries for large roster operations', async () => {
  const mockDb = createQueryCountingMockDatabase();
  const rosterId = 'bulk-test';
  const players = Array.from({ length: 50 }, (_, i) => `player${i}`);

  await bulkAddPlayersToRoster(rosterId, players);

  // Should use batch insert, not individual queries
  expect(mockDb.queryCount).toBeLessThanOrEqual(3); // 1 validation, 1 batch insert, 1 update
});
```

#### **Type Safety & Validation Testing**
```typescript
// Common Issue: Type safety in drag-and-drop operations
interface DragPayload {
  type: 'PLAYER';
  playerId: string;
  currentPosition: Position;
  playerData: Player;
}

test('validates drag payload types at runtime', () => {
  const validPayload: DragPayload = {
    type: 'PLAYER',
    playerId: 'player123',
    currentPosition: 'WR',
    playerData: mockPlayer
  };

  expect(validateDragPayload(validPayload)).toBe(true);

  const invalidPayload = {
    type: 'INVALID',
    playerId: 'player123'
  };

  expect(() => validateDragPayload(invalidPayload)).toThrow('Invalid drag payload');
});

test('enforces position eligibility rules', () => {
  const qbPlayer = createPlayer({ position: 'QB', eligiblePositions: ['QB'] });
  const rbPosition = 'RB';

  expect(canPlayerPlayPosition(qbPlayer, rbPosition)).toBe(false);

  const flexPlayer = createPlayer({
    position: 'RB',
    eligiblePositions: ['RB', 'WR', 'FLEX']
  });

  expect(canPlayerPlayPosition(flexPlayer, 'FLEX')).toBe(true);
});
```

#### **End-to-End Roster Management Flow**
```typescript
// Playwright E2E testing
test('complete roster management workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await loginUser(page, 'manager@example.com', 'password');
  await page.goto('/league/league123/roster');

  // Verify initial roster state
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="QB-position"]')).toContainText('1 / 1');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="RB-position"]')).toContainText('2 / 3');

  // Drag player from bench to starting lineup
  const benchPlayer = page.locator('[data-testid="bench-player-456"]');
  const rbPosition = page.locator('[data-testid="RB-dropzone"]');

  await benchPlayer.dragTo(rbPosition);

  // Verify roster update
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="RB-position"]')).toContainText('3 / 3');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="save-roster"]')).toBeEnabled();

  // Save changes
  await page.click('[data-testid="save-roster"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toContainText('Roster saved');
});
```

**Key Testing Patterns (2025 Standards):**

| Test Category | Focus | Common Pitfall | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Drag-and-Drop UI | Interaction simulation, visual feedback | Not testing accessibility | Use keyboard navigation tests |
| Database Transactions | Atomicity, constraint validation | Missing rollback scenarios | Test with forced failures |
| Concurrency | Race conditions, data integrity | Not testing simultaneous operations | Use Promise.allSettled patterns |
| Type Safety | Runtime validation, payload integrity | Assuming compile-time safety | Add runtime type guards |

**Essential Testing Focus:**
- **UI Interaction Fidelity**: Test complete drag-and-drop sequences with visual feedback
- **Transaction Atomicity**: Verify database rollback on any operation failure
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Test all business rules at database and application levels
