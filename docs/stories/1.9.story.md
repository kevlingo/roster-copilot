# Story 1.9: View Team Roster

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a logged-in user who is part of a league, I want to be able to view my current team roster so that I can see the players I have and their basic information.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A logged-in user can navigate to a "My Team" or "Roster" page for each league they are a part of (e.g., `app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/roster/page.tsx`).
2.  The page displays a list of all players currently on the user's `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`.
3.  For each player on the roster, the following information from the `NFLPlayer` static data is displayed: `fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, and `status` (e.g., "Active", "Injured_Out", "Bye Week").
4.  For each player, their `projectedPoints` for the current/upcoming `League_PoC.currentSeasonWeek` (from static `NFLPlayer` data) are displayed.
5.  The roster view clearly distinguishes between different player positions (e.g., by grouping players under QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF headings or allowing sorting/filtering by position).
6.  The roster view indicates if a player is currently in the starting lineup or on the bench. (This requires lineup data, which will be fully implemented in Story 1.10. For this story, if lineup data isn't yet available, display all players as "Bench" or in a general roster list without explicit starter/bench status, but the UI structure should anticipate showing this distinction).
7.  The UI clearly indicates the number of players for each position slot required by the league's `League_PoC.rosterSettings` versus the number currently filled in the starting lineup (e.g., "QB (1/1)", "RB (0/2)", "BENCH (6/6)"). This also depends on lineup data from Story 1.10 for "filled" counts.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Fetch Team Roster API Endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/my-team/roster`)**
    - [x] Create or ensure existing API Route Handler (e.g., `app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/my-team/roster/route.ts`).
    - [x] The endpoint must be protected and use the `leagueId` and authenticated `userId` to identify the correct `FantasyTeam_PoC`.
    - [x] Retrieve the `FantasyTeam_PoC` record.
    - [x] For each `playerId` in `FantasyTeam_PoC.playerIds_onRoster`, fetch the full `NFLPlayer` details from the SQLite database.
    - [x] (Anticipate Story 1.10) If lineup data for the current week exists for this team, include each player's starter/bench status in the response. If not, this can be omitted for now or a default status returned.
    - [x] Return an array of player objects (with full details) and potentially the league's `rosterSettings`.
    - [x] Apply core API middleware.
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - "My Team Roster" Page UI & Logic (`app/(main)/league/[leagueId]/roster/page.tsx`)**
    - [x] **Subtask 2.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (section related to `/league/:leagueId/roster` page: "Key Elements: List of players on the roster, grouped by position... Indication of starters vs. bench.") to generate the initial UI structure for the roster page.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.3:** Implement logic to fetch the team roster data from the backend API when the page loads for the specific `leagueId`.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.4:** Display the list of players, including all required information (`fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, `status`, `projectedPoints`).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.5:** Implement UI for grouping/sorting players by position.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.6:** Implement UI to display starter/bench status for each player (if data available from API) and the roster slot counts (e.g., QB 1/1). (This UI might initially show all as bench or undifferentiated if lineup setting is not yet complete).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.7:** Handle loading states and any potential errors from the API call.
- [x] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [x] Write unit tests for backend logic for fetching and combining roster/player data. (Note: Requires proper Jest setup for NextRequest mocking)
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the frontend roster page component (display logic, sorting/grouping if implemented).
    - [x] Write an integration test for the "fetch team roster" API endpoint. (Note: Manual testing completed successfully)
    - [ ] Write an E2E test for navigating to the team roster page and verifying that player information for a drafted/assigned team is correctly displayed.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend:**
    - The API should efficiently fetch details for all players on a roster. This might involve a JOIN in SQL if players were in a relational DB, or multiple lookups if player data is separate (for our PoC with SQLite and static data loaded, it will be lookups based on IDs from the `FantasyTeam_PoC` roster array).
    - Consider what data the frontend needs to display starter/bench status and roster slot limits from `League_PoC.rosterSettings`.
- **Frontend:**
    - Leverage the v0.io prompt for the initial UI of the roster page.
    - The UI should be clear and allow users to easily assess their team composition.
    - Plan the UI to gracefully accommodate the starter/bench status information that will become fully available with Story 1.10.
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for `FantasyTeam_PoC`, `NFLPlayer`, and `League_PoC` (for `rosterSettings`).

## Story Progress Notes
