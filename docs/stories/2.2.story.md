# Story 2.2: Core Conversational Guided Questionnaire for Eager Learner

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user who has selected the "Eager Learner" archetype, I want to continue the conversation with a basic guided questionnaire so that the AI Copilot can establish my essential baseline preferences for personalized advice.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  When a user selects "Eager Learner" archetype in Story 2.1, the AI Copilot seamlessly continues the conversation with the guided questionnaire without requiring page navigation or UI changes.
2.  The AI Copilot introduces the questionnaire purpose conversationally (e.g., "Perfect! Since you're eager to learn, I'd like to ask a few quick questions to personalize my advice for you.").
3.  The questionnaire consists of 2-3 key questions presented conversationally, designed to capture baseline preferences as defined in `Architecture.md#UserProfile`:
    * `preferredExplanationDepth` - Asked conversationally (e.g., "When I explain strategies, would you prefer: 1) Simple and quick, 2) Standard detail, or 3) Deep dive explanations?")
    * `riskComfortLevel` - Asked conversationally (e.g., "How do you feel about taking risks with your lineup? 1) Play it safe, 2) Balanced approach, or 3) Go big or go home?")
    * Optional third question based on PM/PO definition, presented in conversational format.
4.  Each question allows for natural language responses (number selection, option names, or conversational answers that can be mapped to the defined options).
5.  The AI Copilot confirms each answer and provides encouraging feedback before moving to the next question.
6.  Upon completion of all questions, the AI Copilot summarizes the user's preferences and confirms the setup is complete.
7.  The user's answers are persisted to the user's `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers` object via an API call to `PUT /api/users/me`.
8.  After successful persistence, the AI Copilot provides next steps and transitions the user to the main application or next onboarding phase.
9.  The conversational flow handles edge cases (unclear responses, requests to change previous answers, technical errors) with friendly, helpful responses.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - Extend conversation state management from Story 2.1 for questionnaire flow
    - Use existing `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` component for questionnaire interactions
    - Implement basic response processing for questionnaire answers
    - Focus on core questionnaire functionality without advanced features
- **Backend:**
    - Use existing `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint for `onboardingAnswers` field updates
    - Basic error handling for questionnaire API failures
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers` structure
- **Conversation Design:**
    - Keep questionnaire scripts simple and focused on preference capture
    - Handle basic response patterns for explanation depth and risk comfort questions
- **Integration:** Seamless continuation from Story 2.1 archetype selection
- **Scope:** Core questionnaire functionality only - advanced features handled in other stories
