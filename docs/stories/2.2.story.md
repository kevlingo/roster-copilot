# Story 2.2: Implement Brief Guided Questionnaire for Eager Learner Archetype Users

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As a new user who has selected the "Eager Learner" archetype, I want to answer a brief, guided questionnaire so that the AI Copilot can establish my essential baseline preferences for personalized advice.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  If a user's `UserProfile.selectedArchetype` is "Eager Learner" (confirmed after Story 2.1), they are immediately presented with a short questionnaire (e.g., within the `AIPanel.tsx` on the `/onboarding` page).
2.  The questionnaire consists of 2-3 key questions designed to capture baseline preferences, as defined in `Architecture.md#UserProfile`:
    * `preferredExplanationDepth` (options: "simple," "standard," "detailed").
    * `riskComfortLevel` (options: "low," "medium," "high").
    * (A third question, if defined by PM/PO, e.g., "What aspect of fantasy football are you most interested in learning about?" with predefined options).
3.  Each question is presented clearly with straightforward options for answers (e.g., using DaisyUI radio buttons or select components).
4.  The user's answers are captured by the frontend.
5.  Upon completion/submission of the questionnaire, the answers are persisted to the user's `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers` object via an API call.
6.  The user is informed (e.g., within the `AIPanel.tsx`) that their initial preferences are set.
7.  After completing the questionnaire, the user proceeds to the next step in the onboarding flow (e.g., profile confirmation/explanation of "Learn-As-You-Go" from Story 2.3, or to the main application dashboard `/dashboard`).
8.  The exact question wording and answer options will be finalized as per `UIUX_Spec.md` or content provided by PM/PO.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Ensure Profile Update Capability for Onboarding Answers**
    - [ ] Verify the existing `PUT /api/users/me` API endpoint (from Story 1.4) can accept and update the `UserProfile.onboardingAnswers` object (including `preferredExplanationDepth`, `riskComfortLevel`, and any other defined questions).
    - [ ] Ensure backend validation allows for the defined option values for each answer.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend - Questionnaire UI & Logic (within `AIPanel.tsx` or a dedicated onboarding component)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** Design and implement the UI for presenting the 2-3 questionnaire questions and their respective answer options (e.g., using DaisyUI radio groups or styled select components). This UI will be conditionally rendered if `selectedArchetype` is "Eager Learner".
        * *Dev Note:* The v0.io prompt did not specifically detail a "questionnaire component." The Developer Agent may need to construct this using standard form elements styled with Tailwind/DaisyUI or prompt v0.io for a generic "question with multiple choice options" component.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.2:** Ensure the UI adheres to `Frontend-Architecture.md` and `UIUX_Spec.md`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.3:** Manage the state for the user's answers to the questionnaire locally as they fill it out.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.4:** Implement a "Submit Answers" or "Continue" button for the questionnaire. On click, this button will:
        - [ ] Trigger an API call to `PUT /api/users/me` with the `onboardingAnswers` object.
        - [ ] On successful API response, navigate the user to the next onboarding step or app dashboard.
    - [ ] **Subtask 2.5:** Handle API loading and error states appropriately.
- [ ] **Task 3: Content Finalization**
    - [ ] Confirm and document the exact wording for the questionnaire questions and their answer options.
- [ ] **Task 4: Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the frontend questionnaire component (displaying questions, capturing answers, submission logic).
    - [ ] Write an integration test for the `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint specifically for updating the `onboardingAnswers`.
    - [ ] Write an E2E test for the "Eager Learner" onboarding flow: user selects "Eager Learner," is presented with the questionnaire, answers questions, submits, and the preferences are persisted (verifiable if next step changes or by checking profile data if feasible in E2E).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Frontend:**
    - The questionnaire UI should be presented conditionally based on the `UserProfile.selectedArchetype`. This state would likely be available via the session or user profile context/store.
    - The UI for questions and answers should be simple and intuitive (e.g., radio buttons for mutually exclusive choices).
    - The component responsible for this should reside logically within the onboarding flow, likely interacting with or being part of the `AIPanel.tsx` or a component rendered on the `/onboarding` page.
- **Backend:**
    - The `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint needs to robustly handle updates to the nested `onboardingAnswers` object within `UserProfile`.
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for the `UserProfile` data model, specifically the `onboardingAnswers` structure (`preferredExplanationDepth`, `riskComfortLevel`).
- **Content:** Question and answer text should be easily configurable or sourced from a constants file if not hardcoded.
