# Story 5.3: Implement Chat Bubble Overlay Component

## Status: Accepted

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see a scrollable overlay of recent chat messages
- so that I can review the conversation history while interacting with the page.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** A `ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx` component is created to display a list of `ChatMessageBubble` components.
2.  **AC2:** The overlay is positioned in a corner of the screen (e.g., bottom-right or bottom-left) above the `ChatInput` area, as per UI Spec section 2.2 & 2.4.2.
3.  **AC3:** The overlay displays the latest 3-4 messages by default.
4.  **AC4:** If chat history exceeds the visible height (3-4 messages), a vertical scrollbar appears within the overlay, allowing users to view older messages.
5.  **AC5:** The overlay area itself does not have a transparent/semi-transparent background; underlying content is visible *around* the opaque chat bubbles. (UI Spec 2.4.2)
6.  **AC6:** The overlay can be hidden or shown. (Visibility managed by `PersistentChatInterface`).
7.  **AC7:** The component correctly renders a list of `ChatMessageBubble` components based on the `chatHistory` prop.
8.  **AC8:** New messages dynamically appear in the overlay.
9.  **AC9:** The component is keyboard accessible (scrollable area) as per WCAG 2.1 AA+ (UI Spec section 2.7).
10. **AC10:** `aria-live` attributes are used correctly so screen readers announce new messages (UI Spec 2.7).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1:** Create the `ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx` component structure. (AC: 1)
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement props for `messages` array and `isVisible`. (Control handlers are no longer part of this component).
- [x] **Task 2:** Implement overlay positioning and styling. (AC: 2, 5)
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Style the overlay container using Tailwind CSS as per UI Spec 2.4.2.
- [x] **Task 3:** Implement message rendering and scrolling. (AC: 3, 4, 7, 8)
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Render a list of `ChatMessageBubble` components from the `messages` prop.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Implement vertical scrolling when content overflows.
    - [x] Subtask 3.3: Ensure only the latest 3-4 messages are visible by default before scrolling.
- [x] **Task 4:** Handle overlay visibility. (AC: 6)
    - [x] Subtask 4.1: Conditionally render the overlay based on the `isVisible` prop.
- [x] **Task 5:** Implement accessibility features. (AC: 9, 10)
    - [x] Subtask 5.1: Ensure scrollable area is keyboard accessible.
    - [x] Subtask 5.2: Add appropriate ARIA attributes for live regions.
- [x] **Task 6:** Write unit tests for `ChatBubbleOverlay` component.

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   Refer to UI/UX Design Spec section 2.4.2 (`ChatBubbleOverlay`) and section 2.2 (Wireframes) in [`docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md`](docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md).
-   Component path: `src/components/ai-chat/ChatBubbleOverlay.tsx` as per Frontend Architecture Plan (section 3.1).
-   Receives `messages` array and `visibility` status from `PersistentChatInterface.tsx`. (Control handlers for hide/settings are no longer passed to this component).
-   Manages internal scrolling.
-   Uses `ChatMessageBubble.tsx` to render individual messages.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- **Updated 2025-06-03:** This story and component have been updated to reflect a design change. The `HideChatButton` and `ChatSettings` button are no longer part of, or controlled by, the `ChatBubbleOverlay`. These controls are now located within the `ChatInput` component.
- The bottom positioning of the overlay (`bottom-16`) assumes a fixed height for the `ChatInput` component. If `ChatInput` height changes, this might need adjustment.
- The test for scrolling behavior (`scrollIntoView`) is mocked, as JSDOM does not support layout-dependent features like scrolling. Manual verification is recommended for this aspect.
- Linting reported errors in files unrelated to this story. The files modified/created for Story 5.3 are lint-free.
