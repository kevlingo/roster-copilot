# Story 1.2: User Login

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a registered user, I want to be able to log in to my Roster Copilot account using my credentials so that I can access my leagues and personalized features.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  User can navigate to a Login page/form (e.g., `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`).
2.  Login form requires the user's email address (or username, though email is specified as primary in `UserProfile`) and password.
3.  Upon submitting valid credentials, the system authenticates the user against their stored `UserProfile` (specifically checking the email and hashed password).
4.  The system verifies that the `UserProfile.emailVerified` status is `true` before allowing login.
5.  Upon successful authentication and email verification:
    * A persistent session is created for the logged-in user (e.g., using JWTs stored securely as per `Architecture.md` security best practices).
    * The user is granted access to the authenticated parts of the application.
    * The user is redirected to their main dashboard (e.g., `/dashboard`).
6.  If authentication fails (e.g., incorrect email/password, or `UserProfile.emailVerified` is `false`):
    * A clear and non-specific error message (e.g., "Invalid credentials. Please check your email and password, or ensure your email is verified.") is displayed.
    * The user remains on the Login page.
7.  The system includes protection against brute-force login attempts (e.g., rate limiting on the login API endpoint â€“ as a general security NFR from `Architecture.md`).
8.  The Login page provides a link to "Forgot Password?" functionality (to be implemented in Story 1.5).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Login API Endpoint (`/api/auth/login`)**
    - [x] Create API Route Handler at `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`.
    - [x] Implement input DTO validation (email, password).
    - [x] Retrieve `UserProfile` by email.
    - [x] If user found, verify submitted password against stored hash.
    - [x] Check if `UserProfile.emailVerified` is `true`.
    - [x] If authentication and verification are successful, generate session token (e.g., JWT with appropriate claims and expiry).
    - [x] Implement rate limiting on this endpoint.
    - [x] Return user information and token in the response.
    - [x] Apply core API middleware (error handling, logging from Story 1.0.3).
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - Login Page UI & Logic (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)**
    - [x] **Subtask 2.1:** Use the v0.io prompt (section related to `/login` page: "UI: Form with fields for email/username and password. 'Login' button. Link to 'Forgot Password?'") to generate initial UI structure for the Login page.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.2:** Review and adapt generated code. Ensure adherence to `Frontend-Architecture.md` (directory, naming, Tailwind/DaisyUI, AX).
    - [x] **Subtask 2.3:** Implement client-side form state management.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.4:** Implement client-side validation for form fields. (Fixed: Removed HTML5 `required` attributes that were preventing custom validation)
    - [x] **Subtask 2.5:** Implement API call to the Login endpoint on form submission.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.6:** Upon successful login, securely store the session token (e.g., in memory via Zustand store, as per `Frontend-Architecture.md` token handling strategy) and user information.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.7:** Redirect to the dashboard (`/dashboard`) upon successful login.
    - [x] **Subtask 2.8:** Handle and display API error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials," "Email not verified").
    - [x] **Subtask 2.9:** Implement the "Forgot Password?" link (pointing to the route for Story 1.5).
- [x] **Task 3: Testing**
    - [x] Write unit tests for backend authentication logic (password verification, email verification check).
    - [x] Write unit tests for frontend login form component (validation, submission). (Client-side validation tests now passing after removing `required` attributes from inputs).
    - [x] Write integration tests for the login API endpoint, including scenarios for success, invalid credentials, and unverified email.
    - [x] Write E2E test for the user login flow (happy path, incorrect password, unverified email) using Playwright.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Backend Security & Authentication (2025 Best Practices)**
- **Data Models**: Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile` data model (including `emailVerified` field) and authentication/session management strategy
- **Password Security**: Use bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds for password verification (matching Story 1.1 standards)
- **JWT Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { userId, email, role, iat: Date.now() },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET!,
    { expiresIn: '24h', algorithm: 'HS256' }
  );
  ```
- **Input Validation**: Implement Zod schemas for login validation:
  ```typescript
  const LoginSchema = z.object({
    email: z.string().email(),
    password: z.string().min(1, "Password is required")
  });
  ```
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement progressive delays for failed login attempts
- **Security Headers**: Set appropriate CORS, CSP, and security headers

### **Frontend Development (Next.js 15 + React 19)**
- **Form Handling**: Use `useActionState` for form state management with server actions
- **State Management**: Secure token storage using Zustand with proper serialization
- **Session Management**: Implement automatic token refresh and secure logout
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with proper accessibility
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking for authentication state and user data
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 compliance with proper form labels and ARIA attributes

### **Testing Strategy (2025 Standards)**
- **Unit Testing**: Focus on user authentication flows and error scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Test login API with various credential combinations
- **E2E Testing**: Complete login journey with session persistence validation
- **Security Testing**: Test rate limiting, CSRF protection, and token validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated testing with axe-core integration

### **Performance & Security**
- **API Middleware**: Apply core middleware (error handling, logging, rate limiting) from Story 1.0.3
- **Session Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags and SameSite protection
- **Token Management**: Implement token rotation and secure storage patterns
- **Monitoring**: Log authentication events for security analysis

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- Dependency `jsonwebtoken` and `@types/jsonwebtoken` approved by user on 2025-06-04.
- Dependency `zustand` approved by user on 2025-06-04.
- **2025-06-04 (Dev Agent):** Encountering persistent issues with frontend tests for client-side validation messages in `app/(auth)/login/page.test.tsx`. The `error` state in the `LoginPage` component does not appear to update as expected during test execution, preventing validation messages from rendering and being found by the tests. Multiple debugging strategies (query adjustments, `act` usage, error display refactoring, `userEvent.setup()`) have been attempted without success. Escalated to user for guidance. Current `Status: InProgress`.
- **2025-06-04 (User & Dev Agent):** Root cause for failing client-side validation tests identified: HTML5 `required` attributes on form inputs were preventing `handleSubmit` from being called. User removed these attributes. All tests now pass.

## Current Implementation References (2025)

### **Technology Stack Updates**
- **Authentication**: JWT with HS256 algorithm, 24-hour expiry, secure claims
- **State Management**: Zustand for secure client-side session management
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and input validation
- **Security**: bcrypt 12+ rounds, rate limiting, CSRF protection
- **Testing**: Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright for comprehensive coverage

### **Modern Security Patterns**
- **Progressive Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff for failed login attempts
- **Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags and SameSite protection
- **Token Security**: Automatic refresh, secure storage, and proper expiration handling
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation with Zod schemas
- **Monitoring**: Authentication event logging for security analysis

### **Frontend Enhancements**
- **Server Actions**: Use `useActionState` for form handling and state management
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling with React 19 features
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 compliance with automated testing
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and Core Web Vitals monitoring
