# Story 5.1: Implement Persistent Chat Input Component

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a user
- I want a persistent chat input textbox at the bottom of the screen
- so that I can easily send messages to the AI Copilot at any time.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** A chat input textbox (`ChatInput`) is fixed at the bottom of the viewport.
2.  **AC2:** The textbox width is responsive, typically 60-80% of viewport width (centered or aligned), with a max-width for very large screens, as per UI Spec section 2.4.1.
3.  **AC3:** The textbox height is standard input field height, potentially expanding for multi-line input.
4.  **AC4:** The textbox background is a neutral, inviting color (e.g., light grey `#F3F4F6` or Tailwind `bg-gray-100`).
5.  **AC5:** The textbox has a subtle border or slightly darker background to differentiate it from the page.
6.  **AC6:** Placeholder text (e.g., "Type your message...") is visible when the textbox is empty.
7.  **AC7:** The textbox is always focused or easily focusable.
8.  **AC8:** Users can type messages into the textbox.
9.  **AC9:** Users can submit messages by pressing the "Enter" key (configurable: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line).
10. **AC10:** A "Send" icon button is present within the `ChatInput` component, and clicking it submits the message.
11. **AC11:** The component handles default, focused, and typing states as per UI Spec section 2.4.1.
12. **AC12:** The input field is disabled if the AI is processing and cannot accept new input (rare, as per UI Spec section 2.4.1).
13. **AC13:** The component is keyboard accessible as per WCAG 2.1 AA+ (UI Spec section 2.7).
14. **AC14:** Clear focus indicators are present for the input field and all interactive controls (Send, Hide, Settings buttons).
15. **AC15:** The `ChatInput` component includes a `HideChatButton` control that, when clicked, triggers a handler to hide the chat overlay (as per UI Spec section 2.4.1 and 2.4.3).
16. **AC16:** The `ChatInput` component includes a `ChatSettings` button control that, when clicked, triggers a handler to open chat settings (as per UI Spec section 2.4.1 and 2.4.4).

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   Refer to UI/UX Design Spec section 2.4.1 (`ChatInput`), 2.4.3 (`HideChatButton`), 2.4.4 (`ChatSettings`) and section 2.3 (Visual Design) in [`docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md`](docs/AI_Chat_Interface_Design_Frontend_Architecture.md).
-   Component path: `src/components/ai-chat/ChatInput.tsx` as per Frontend Architecture Plan (section 3.1).
-   State for `inputValue` and handlers for `onSubmit`, `onHideOverlay`, and `onClearHistory` (or a general settings handler) should be managed by the parent `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` component and passed as props.
-   Use Tailwind CSS for styling, leveraging colors defined in UI Spec section 2.3.
-   Icons should be sourced from Material Icons, Heroicons, or Feather Icons as per UI Spec section 2.5.

**2. Coding Standards & Project Structure:**
    - [x] All new/modified code strictly adheres to `Operational Guidelines`. (Assumed, as no specific conflicting guidelines were encountered).
    - [x] All new/modified code aligns with `Project Structure` (file locations: `src/components/ai-chat/ChatInput.tsx`, `src/components/ai-chat/PersistentChatInterface.tsx`, `src/components/ai-chat/ChatInput.test.tsx`; naming conventions followed).
    - [x] Adherence to `Tech Stack` for technologies/versions used (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide-React).
    - [N/A] Adherence to `Api Reference` and `Data Models` (Story does not involve API or data model changes for ChatInput itself).
    - [x] Basic security best practices (e.g., input validation via `trim()`, proper error handling (basic), no hardcoded secrets) applied for new/modified code. (Note: Full error handling for API calls etc. is for later stories).
    - [x] No new linter errors or warnings introduced *by this story's changes*. (Pre-existing errors noted).
    - [x] Code is well-commented where necessary (interfaces, complex logic like keydown).

**3. Testing:**
    - [x] All required unit tests as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented for `ChatInput.tsx` including its integrated buttons.
    - [N/A] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented. (Integration tests would be more for `PersistentChatInterface` with other components, out of scope for this specific component's unit tests).
    - [x] All tests (unit) pass successfully for `ChatInput.tsx`.
    - [ ] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined). (Coverage not explicitly run/checked as part of this task, but comprehensive unit tests written for component logic).

**4. Functionality & Verification:**
    - [ ] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (e.g., running the app locally, checking UI, testing API endpoints). (Cannot be fully verified without integrating `PersistentChatInterface` into a page).
    - [x] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully (e.g., disabled state, empty input submission).

**5. Story Administration:**
    - [x] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
    - [x] Any clarifications or decisions made during development are documented in the story file or linked appropriately. (Dependency approval documented).
    - [x] The story wrap up section has been completed with notes of changes or information relevant to the next story or overall project, the agent model that was primarily used during development, and the changelog of any changes is properly updated. (Will be completed now).

**6. Dependencies, Build & Configuration:**
    - [ ] Project builds successfully without errors. (Build fails due to pre-existing lint errors in other project files. No build errors caused by this story's code.)
    - [ ] Project linting passes. (Linting for files changed in this story passes. Overall project linting fails due to pre-existing issues.)
    - [x] Any new dependencies added were either pre-approved in the story requirements OR explicitly approved by the user during development (approval documented in story file). (Testing libraries approved and installed).
    - [x] If new dependencies were added, they are recorded in the appropriate project files (`package.json`) with justification (standard testing libraries).
    - [x] No known security vulnerabilities introduced by newly added and approved dependencies (standard testing libraries, latest versions used at time of install).
    - [N/A] If new environment variables or configurations were introduced by the story, they are documented and handled securely.

**7. Documentation (If Applicable):**
    - [x] Relevant inline code documentation (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc) for new public APIs or complex logic is complete (Interface props, function descriptions).
    - [N/A] User-facing documentation updated, if changes impact users. (Component not yet visible to users).
    - [N/A] Technical documentation (e.g., READMEs, system diagrams) updated if significant architectural changes were made. (No significant architectural changes from this component alone).

**Final Confirmation:**
    - [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed to the best of my ability within the scope of this story. Some items (overall build/lint, full manual verification) are dependent on project state outside this story or future integration.
