# Story 1.0.1: Generate Static NFL Player and Game JSON Data Files

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a Developer/System, I need to generate static JSON data files containing representative NFL player information and a simplified NFL game schedule for the PoC so that this data is available for seeding into the SQLite database and for use by the application.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A JSON file named `nfl-players.json` is created and placed in the `data/static-nfl-data/` directory (as per `Architecture.md` project structure [cite: 1100]).
2.  `nfl-players.json` contains an array of at least 50-100 unique, representative fictional NFL players.
3.  Each player object in `nfl-players.json` adheres to the `NFLPlayer` schema defined in `Architecture.md` (including `playerId`, `fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, `status`, `projectedPoints`, `keyAttributes`, `notes`).
    * Ensure a variety of positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF).
    * Include a mix of player statuses (Active, Injured_Out, Injured_Questionable, Bye Week).
    * Populate `projectedPoints` with sample data for at least one PoC week.
    * Populate `keyAttributes` and `notes` with plausible sample data.
4.  A JSON file named `nfl-games.json` is created and placed in the `data/static-nfl-data/` directory.
5.  `nfl-games.json` contains an array of simplified NFL game objects for a PoC season (e.g., at least 1-2 weeks of games for 8-12 fictional NFL teams).
6.  Each game object in `nfl-games.json` adheres to the `NFLGame` schema defined in `Architecture.md` (including `gameId`, `weekNumber`, `homeTeamAbbreviation`, `awayTeamAbbreviation`, `gameDateTime_ISO`, `matchupContextNotes`, `homeScore`, `awayScore`, `gameStatus`).
    * Ensure `homeTeamAbbreviation` and `awayTeamAbbreviation` correspond to `nflTeamAbbreviation` values used in `nfl-players.json`.
7.  The generated JSON data is well-formatted and valid.
8.  The generation process **should leverage data generation libraries where appropriate** (e.g., for unique IDs, fictional names, basic numerical data) but **must also ensure the generated data is contextually plausible for an NFL PoC.** This may involve custom scripting, configuration of the generation library, or manual curation/adjustment of library outputs to achieve realistic player profiles, team assignments, game schedules, and relevant attributes/notes.
9.  (Optional but recommended) The generation process is documented or scripted (e.g., in `scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts`) if it involves more than manual creation, to allow for regeneration if needed.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Data Models:** Strictly adhere to `NFLPlayer` and `NFLGame` TypeScript interfaces defined in `Architecture.md` Data Models section for the structure of objects within the JSON files.
    - `NFLPlayer`: `playerId: string; fullName: string; position: "QB" | "RB" | "WR" | "TE" | "K" | "DEF"; nflTeamAbbreviation: string; status?: "Active" | "Injured_Out" | "Injured_Questionable" | "Bye Week"; projectedPoints?: number; keyAttributes?: { consistencyRating?: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"; upsidePotential?: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"; role?: string; }; notes?: string;`
    - `NFLGame`: `gameId: string; weekNumber: number; homeTeamAbbreviation: string; awayTeamAbbreviation: string; gameDateTime_ISO?: string; matchupContextNotes?: string[]; homeScore?: number; awayScore?: number; gameStatus?: "Scheduled" | "InProgress" | "Final";`
- **Output Location:** Files must be placed in `data/static-nfl-data/` as specified in the `Architecture.md` project structure[cite: 1100].
- **Data Plausibility:** While fictional, the data should feel like it *could* be real NFL data (e.g., reasonable player names for their fictional teams, logical game schedules, projected points within typical ranges for positions).
- **Scripting:** If scripting the generation (recommended), Node.js/TypeScript is preferred to align with the project stack, but a Python script is also acceptable if more convenient for data generation libraries. Place scripts in a `scripts/data-generation/` directory.
- **Data Generation Libraries:** Consider using libraries like Faker.js (for Node.js/TS) or Faker (for Python) to help generate realistic-sounding names, team assignments, etc., but customize outputs to fit NFL context.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`

### Completion Notes List

- **2025-06-01:** Requesting approval for `Faker.js` library.
    - **Need:** To generate realistic fictional data (names, etc.) for `nfl-players.json` and `nfl-games.json` as recommended in AC#8 and Dev Technical Guidance.
    - **Justification:** Faker.js is a widely used library for this purpose and aligns with the project's Node.js/TypeScript stack. It will significantly speed up the generation of plausible PoC data.
    - **Alternatives Considered:** Manual data creation (too slow and error-prone for 50-100 players and multiple game weeks). Other libraries might exist but Faker.js is well-known and suitable.
    - **Approval:** User approved `@faker-js/faker` on 2025-06-01.
- **2025-06-01:** Blocker: Unable to execute `scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts`.
    - **Issue:** Encountered persistent errors attempting to run the script using `ts-node` (TypeScript errors, ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION) and by compiling with `tsc` then running with `node` (MODULE_NOT_FOUND, likely due to tsc output path issues or project-wide TS errors preventing clean compilation).
    - **Attempts Made:**
        1. `npx ts-node ./scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts` (Resulted in TS errors within the script, then ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION after script correction).
        2. `npx ts-node --esm ./scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts` (Still ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION).
        3. Temporarily modified `tsconfig.json` (noEmit: false, outDir), then `npx tsc ./scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts --skipLibCheck true`, then `node ./dist_scripts/scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.js` (MODULE_NOT_FOUND).
        4. Tried `node ./dist_scripts/generate-static-data.js` (MODULE_NOT_FOUND).
    - **Analysis:** The project's current TypeScript/Node.js execution environment has issues, compounded by existing TypeScript errors in other project files (e.g., Header.tsx, main.tsx, vite.config.ts) that interfere with clean compilation attempts. Modifying `tsconfig.json` for a one-off script compilation is also problematic.
    - **Request:** Requesting guidance on how to proceed with executing this data generation script or an alternative approach to create the static JSON files.
    - **Resolution (2025-06-01):** User suggested searching for solutions. After further debugging (installing `ts-node` locally, configuring `package.json` for type:module, `tsconfig.json` for ESM, and correcting `__dirname` usage in script), the script `scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts` was successfully run using `node --loader ts-node/esm ./scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts`. Temporary config changes were reverted. Vulnerabilities noted from `npm install @faker-js/faker` (3) and `npm install ts-node` (3 additional) - these may be the same or cumulative, to be addressed if they become blockers for other stories or by a dedicated tech debt story.

    - [x] No new linter errors or warnings introduced. (Project has existing TS errors, but the new script itself is clean. `eslint . --ext .ts` would show project errors.)
    - [x] Code is well-commented where necessary (clarifying complex logic, not obvious statements). (Script has comments for key sections.)

3.  **Testing:**
    - [N/A] All required unit tests as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented. (No specific unit tests requested for this data generation script itself in ACs. Validation is manual/visual.)
    - [N/A] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
    - [N/A] All tests (unit, integration, E2E if applicable) pass successfully.
    - [N/A] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined).
