# Story 1.0.1: Generate Static NFL Player and Game JSON Data Files

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 1 - Core Platform Foundation & League Engagement MVP

## Story

- As a Developer/System, I need to generate static JSON data files containing representative NFL player information and a simplified NFL game schedule for the PoC so that this data is available for seeding into the SQLite database and for use by the application.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A JSON file named `nfl-players.json` is created and placed in the `data/static-nfl-data/` directory (as per `Architecture.md` project structure [cite: 1100]).
2.  `nfl-players.json` contains an array of at least 50-100 unique, representative fictional NFL players.
3.  Each player object in `nfl-players.json` adheres to the `NFLPlayer` schema defined in `Architecture.md` (including `playerId`, `fullName`, `position`, `nflTeamAbbreviation`, `status`, `projectedPoints`, `keyAttributes`, `notes`).
    * Ensure a variety of positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF).
    * Include a mix of player statuses (Active, Injured_Out, Injured_Questionable, Bye Week).
    * Populate `projectedPoints` with sample data for at least one PoC week.
    * Populate `keyAttributes` and `notes` with plausible sample data.
4.  A JSON file named `nfl-games.json` is created and placed in the `data/static-nfl-data/` directory.
5.  `nfl-games.json` contains an array of simplified NFL game objects for a PoC season (e.g., at least 1-2 weeks of games for 8-12 fictional NFL teams).
6.  Each game object in `nfl-games.json` adheres to the `NFLGame` schema defined in `Architecture.md` (including `gameId`, `weekNumber`, `homeTeamAbbreviation`, `awayTeamAbbreviation`, `gameDateTime_ISO`, `matchupContextNotes`, `homeScore`, `awayScore`, `gameStatus`).
    * Ensure `homeTeamAbbreviation` and `awayTeamAbbreviation` correspond to `nflTeamAbbreviation` values used in `nfl-players.json`.
7.  The generated JSON data is well-formatted and valid.
8.  The generation process **should leverage data generation libraries where appropriate** (e.g., for unique IDs, fictional names, basic numerical data) but **must also ensure the generated data is contextually plausible for an NFL PoC.** This may involve custom scripting, configuration of the generation library, or manual curation/adjustment of library outputs to achieve realistic player profiles, team assignments, game schedules, and relevant attributes/notes.
9.  (Optional but recommended) The generation process is documented or scripted (e.g., in `scripts/data-generation/generate-static-data.ts`) if it involves more than manual creation, to allow for regeneration if needed.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1:** Define/Confirm Fictional NFL Team List
    - [ ] Create a list of 8-12 fictional NFL team abbreviations (e.g., "LIO", "BEA", "PAC") to be used consistently in `nfl-players.json` and `nfl-games.json`.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Script/Implement `nfl-players.json` Generation
    - [ ] Choose a suitable data generation library/approach (e.g., Faker.js if using Node.js script, or Python equivalent).
    - [ ] Implement logic to generate 50-100 player objects adhering to the `NFLPlayer` schema from `Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] Ensure variety in positions, statuses, and plausible data for `projectedPoints`, `keyAttributes`, and `notes`.
    - [ ] Assign players to the defined fictional NFL teams.
    - [ ] Output to `data/static-nfl-data/nfl-players.json`.
- [ ] **Task 3:** Script/Implement `nfl-games.json` Generation
    - [ ] Implement logic to generate game schedules for 1-2 weeks involving the fictional NFL teams.
    - [ ] Ensure each game object adheres to the `NFLGame` schema from `Architecture.md`.
    - [ ] Populate `gameDateTime_ISO`, `matchupContextNotes`, sample `homeScore`, `awayScore`, and `gameStatus` plausibly.
    - [ ] Output to `data/static-nfl-data/nfl-games.json`.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Validate JSON Outputs
    - [ ] Validate both `nfl-players.json` and `nfl-games.json` for correct JSON format.
    - [ ] Manually review a sample of the generated data to ensure contextual plausibility and adherence to schemas.
- [ ] **Task 5 (Optional but Recommended):** Document Generation Process
    - [ ] If a script is created, add a brief README in `scripts/data-generation/` explaining how to run it and any dependencies.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Data Models:** Strictly adhere to `NFLPlayer` and `NFLGame` TypeScript interfaces defined in `Architecture.md` Data Models section for the structure of objects within the JSON files.
    - `NFLPlayer`: `playerId: string; fullName: string; position: "QB" | "RB" | "WR" | "TE" | "K" | "DEF"; nflTeamAbbreviation: string; status?: "Active" | "Injured_Out" | "Injured_Questionable" | "Bye Week"; projectedPoints?: number; keyAttributes?: { consistencyRating?: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"; upsidePotential?: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"; role?: string; }; notes?: string;`
    - `NFLGame`: `gameId: string; weekNumber: number; homeTeamAbbreviation: string; awayTeamAbbreviation: string; gameDateTime_ISO?: string; matchupContextNotes?: string[]; homeScore?: number; awayScore?: number; gameStatus?: "Scheduled" | "InProgress" | "Final";`
- **Output Location:** Files must be placed in `data/static-nfl-data/` as specified in the `Architecture.md` project structure[cite: 1100].
- **Data Plausibility:** While fictional, the data should feel like it *could* be real NFL data (e.g., reasonable player names for their fictional teams, logical game schedules, projected points within typical ranges for positions).
- **Scripting:** If scripting the generation (recommended), Node.js/TypeScript is preferred to align with the project stack, but a Python script is also acceptable if more convenient for data generation libraries. Place scripts in a `scripts/data-generation/` directory.
- **Data Generation Libraries:** Consider using libraries like Faker.js (for Node.js/TS) or Faker (for Python) to help generate realistic-sounding names, team assignments, etc., but customize outputs to fit NFL context.
