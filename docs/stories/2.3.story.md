# Story 2.3: Develop "Learn-As-You-Go" Mechanism for User Preference Profile Refinement

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP

## Story

- As an active user, I want the AI Copilot to observe my actions and decisions, and when it detects patterns or significant deviations from my current User Preference Profile, I want it to proactively ask for my confirmation to update and refine my profile so that its advice becomes increasingly personalized and accurate over time.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The "AI Copilot Service" (backend logic within Next.js, as per `Architecture.md`) includes a mechanism to "observe" key user actions. For PoC, observed actions are simplified and might include:
    * Analysis of players drafted/added via waivers (e.g., if a user consistently picks players tagged with `keyAttributes.upsidePotential: "High"` when their `riskComfortLevel` is "low").
    * (PoC Stretch) Analysis of lineup choices against projections/risk (e.g., consistently starting high-risk players).
2.  The AI Copilot Service compares observed behaviors against the user's existing `UserProfile` (`selectedArchetype`, `onboardingAnswers`, `learnedObservations`).
3.  (PoC Scope) When a predefined, simplified pattern or deviation is detected (e.g., 2-3 consecutive high-risk waiver claims by a "low-risk" user), the AI Copilot Service generates a contextual refinement prompt.
4.  This refinement prompt is surfaced to the user unobtrusively via the `AIPanel.tsx` (from `UIUX_Spec.md` and v0.io prompt).
5.  The prompt clearly states the observation and asks for confirmation to update preferences (e.g., "I've noticed you've been making some bold waiver claims! Should I adjust your risk profile to consider more high-upside players?").
6.  The user can respond "Yes" / "No" (or similar) via interactive elements within the `AIPanel.tsx`.
7.  If "Yes": The AI Copilot Service (via an API call) updates the `UserProfile` (e.g., adding to `learnedObservations.playerStyleAffinity` or adjusting `riskComfortLevel` or a new numeric `riskToleranceNumeric` field).
8.  If "No": The `UserProfile` is not updated for that observation, and the AI respects this (e.g., by not prompting for the exact same observation too frequently).
9.  The AI Copilot provides brief confirmation of the user's choice within the `AIPanel.tsx`.
10. For PoC, the observation logic and pattern detection are simplified to 1-2 demonstrable scenarios triggered by actions within the static data environment.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Design "Observation" Heuristics & Triggers (AI Copilot Service)**
    - [ ] Define 1-2 simple, detectable patterns for PoC (e.g., "User drafted/added X number of 'high-upside' players despite 'low-risk' profile setting").
    - [ ] Design how user actions (draft picks, waiver adds - from Story 1.8, 1.11 APIs) will be logged or made available to the AI Copilot Service for this analysis. (This might involve the AI Copilot Service itself inspecting team rosters after changes).
- [ ] **Task 2: Backend - Implement Pattern Detection & Prompt Generation (AI Copilot Service)**
    - [ ] Implement logic in AI Copilot Service to analyze relevant user data against their `UserProfile` to detect the defined patterns/triggers.
    - [ ] Implement logic to generate the appropriate refinement prompt text based on the detected pattern.
- [ ] **Task 3: Backend - API for Refinement Interaction**
    - [ ] Create an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/copilot/refinement-prompts`) for the frontend to fetch any pending refinement prompts for the user.
    - [ ] Create an API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/copilot/refinement-response`) for the frontend to send the user's response (Yes/No and prompt ID). This endpoint will trigger the AI Copilot Service to update `UserProfile` if "Yes".
    - [ ] Apply core API middleware.
- [ ] **Task 4: Backend - Update UserProfile based on Response**
    - [ ] Implement logic in AI Copilot Service (triggered by `POST /api/copilot/refinement-response`) to update `UserProfile.learnedObservations` or other relevant preference fields based on an affirmative user response.
- [ ] **Task 5: Frontend - Display Refinement Prompts & Handle Responses (in `AIPanel.tsx`)**
    - [ ] **Subtask 5.1:** Modify `AIPanel.tsx` to periodically poll or fetch pending refinement prompts from `GET /api/copilot/refinement-prompts`.
    - [ ] **Subtask 5.2:** If prompts are available, display the current prompt text with "Yes" and "No" buttons. (UI for this interaction within the panel needs to be designed; v0.io might be prompted for a generic "message with action buttons" component).
    - [ ] **Subtask 5.3:** On user response, call `POST /api/copilot/refinement-response` with the response.
    - [ ] **Subtask 5.4:** Display confirmation message within the panel.
- [ ] **Task 6: Testing**
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend heuristic/pattern detection logic.
    - [ ] Unit tests for backend `UserProfile` update logic based on refinement responses.
    - [ ] Integration tests for `/api/copilot/refinement-prompts` and `/api/copilot/refinement-response` API endpoints.
    - [ ] E2E test:
        - [ ] User performs actions that trigger a defined heuristic (e.g., making several "high-risk" waiver adds).
        - [ ] Verify the refinement prompt appears in the AI Copilot Panel.
        - [ ] User responds "Yes," verify (e.g., via a test API or checking DB if possible for test) that `UserProfile` is updated.
        - [ ] User responds "No" to another prompt, verify profile is not updated.

- [ ] **Task 7: Build and Test Validation**
    - [ ] Build completed successfully with no errors
    - [ ] All tests passing (37 test suites, 301 tests passed)
    - [ ] Fixed NextResponse mocking issues in API tests
    - [ ] Component tests, unit tests, and integration tests all pass
    - [ ] Fixed syntax errors in component integration

- [ ] **Task 8: Story Completion**
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
    - [ ] Learn-As-You-Go mechanism observes user actions and detects patterns
    - [ ] AI Copilot proactively asks for confirmation to update user preferences
    - [ ] Proper loading states, error handling, and accessibility features implemented
    - [ ] Story marked as Complete following BMAD methodology

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend (AI Copilot Service):**
    - The core challenge for PoC is defining *simple but demonstrable* heuristics. Avoid over-engineering pattern detection.
    - Logging user actions for analysis: This could be a separate logging mechanism or the AI Copilot service could query team rosters/transaction logs after certain events. For PoC, direct analysis of current roster state post-waiver might be simplest.
    - `UserProfile` updates should be specific (e.g., adding a tag to `learnedObservations`).
- **Frontend (`AIPanel.tsx`):**
    - The UI for presenting the prompt and capturing the Yes/No response should be simple and clear.
    - Consider how to handle multiple pending prompts if that scenario is possible (PoC might limit to one at a time).
- **Data Models:** Refer to `Architecture.md` for `UserProfile` (especially `selectedArchetype`, `onboardingAnswers`, `learnedObservations`, and potentially new fields like `riskToleranceNumeric`).
- **API Design:** Ensure APIs for fetching prompts and sending responses are lightweight.
