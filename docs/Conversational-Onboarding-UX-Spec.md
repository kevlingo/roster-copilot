- **Key Stories:** Story 2.1 (Enhanced Conversational Archetype Selection) & Story 2.2 (Dynamic Conversational Questionnaire)
- **Technical Foundation:** Gemini API integration with `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` component
- **Core Innovation:** System prompt-driven conversation logic replacing rigid keyword matching

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas
- **Primary:** New fantasy football users ("Eager Learners") seeking guidance and education
- **Secondary:** Experienced users wanting personalized AI assistance without lengthy setup
- **Tertiary:** Busy users preferring quick, intuitive interactions over complex forms

### Usability Goals
- **Conversational Ease:** Onboarding feels like chatting with a knowledgeable friend, not filling out forms

- **Clear Understanding:** Users understand the AI Copilot's purpose and their archetype selection
- **Seamless Integration:** Natural transition from onboarding to main app experience
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of unclear responses or user confusion

### Enhanced Design Principles (Gemini API-Powered)
1. **"AI-Driven Adaptability"** - Dynamic responses based on user personality, tone, and conversation context
2. **"Conversational Intelligence Over Scripts"** - System prompts enable natural dialogue rather than rigid keyword matching
3. **"Personality-Driven Interaction"** - Jake's fantasy football enthusiasm and expertise shine through every exchange
4. **"Contextual Awareness"** - Responses consider conversation history, user sentiment, and implied needs
5. **"Flexible Conversation Paths"** - Multiple routes to the same goal, supporting different communication styles
6. **"Emotional Intelligence"** - Recognize and respond to user excitement, confusion, hesitation, or uncertainty

## Gemini API Integration Strategy

### System Prompt Architecture
The core conversation logic will be embedded in the Gemini API system prompt, enabling:

**üß† Dynamic Conversation Intelligence:**
- **Personality Adaptation:** Jake adapts his communication style to match user energy and preferences
- **Context Retention:** Full conversation memory enables natural references to previous exchanges
- **Sentiment Recognition:** Responds appropriately to user excitement, confusion, or hesitation
- **Fantasy Football Expertise:** Deep knowledge integration for authentic, knowledgeable responses

**üéØ Intelligent Response Generation:**
- **Multi-Path Conversations:** No rigid scripts - multiple ways to reach the same goal
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Interprets user intent beyond keyword matching
- **Conversational Repair:** Graceful handling of misunderstandings or unclear responses
- **Enthusiasm Matching:** Mirrors and amplifies user excitement about fantasy football

**‚ö° Enhanced User Experience:**
- **Reduced Friction:** No need to match exact keywords or phrases
- **Personalized Tone:** Responses feel tailored to individual user communication style
- **Natural Tangents:** Supports follow-up questions and conversation branches
- **Authentic Personality:** Jake feels like a real fantasy football enthusiast, not a chatbot

### Conversation Flow Transformation

**From Rigid Scripts ‚Üí To Dynamic Dialogue:**

**Old Approach (Keyword Matching):**
```
User: "I like data"
System: if (input.includes('data')) return 'Calculated Strategist'
```

**New Approach (Gemini AI):**
```
User: "I'm the type who spends hours looking at player stats and matchup data"
Jake: "Oh man, a fellow data nerd! I love it! You sound like you'd really vibe with the Calculated Strategist approach. You're probably the type who has spreadsheets for your spreadsheets, right? üòÑ That analytical mindset is going to serve you SO well in fantasy. Want me to tell you more about how I can help maximize that data-driven approach?"
```

## Enhanced Conversation Patterns & Examples

### Dynamic Personality-Driven Responses

**üéØ Core Principle:** Jake adapts his communication style to match user energy, expertise level, and personality cues.

#### Example 1: Enthusiastic New User
**User:** "Hey! I'm super excited about fantasy football but honestly have no idea what I'm doing üòÖ"

**Jake's Response:**
"Dude, I LOVE that energy! üî• Welcome to the most addictive hobby ever! Don't worry about not knowing what you're doing - that's exactly why I'm here, and honestly? Some of the best fantasy managers I know started exactly where you are.

You sound like you'd be a perfect fit for what I call the 'Eager Learner' approach - basically, I'll teach you the 'why' behind every decision so you're not just following advice blindly, you're actually becoming a fantasy football genius!

Does that sound like something you'd be into? I promise to make it fun and not overwhelming!"

#### Example 2: Analytical User
**User:** "I've been doing fantasy for a few years. I like to dig into the numbers and really understand the matchups before making decisions."

**Jake's Response:**
"Oh nice, a fellow analytics enthusiast! I can already tell you appreciate the deeper strategy behind fantasy football. You're speaking my language with the matchup analysis - that's exactly the kind of thinking that separates the championship teams from the also-rans.

You sound like what I'd call a 'Calculated Strategist' - someone who wants the data, the context, and the reasoning behind every recommendation. I can definitely work with that approach and give you the kind of detailed analysis that'll make your league mates wonder how you always seem to know which sleepers to pick up.

Sound about right, or do you lean more toward any other approach?"

#### Example 3: Uncertain User
**User:** "I'm not really sure what my style is"

**Jake's Response:**
"No worries at all! That's actually pretty common, and honestly, it's kind of exciting because we get to figure it out together!

Let me ask you this - when you're making decisions in fantasy (or really any decisions), do you tend to:
- Want to understand all the reasoning behind choices?
- Prefer quick, efficient recommendations?
- Like taking bold risks for big payoffs?
- Or focus on data and analysis?

There's no wrong answer here - I'm just trying to get a feel for how your brain works so I can be the most helpful copilot possible!"

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Enhanced Conversational Archetype Selection (Story 2.1)

**Goal:** User discovers their Fantasy Manager Archetype through engaging, adaptive conversation

**Enhanced Conversation Flow:**

1. **Jake's Dynamic Greeting**

   - Creates immediate connection and excitement

   **Example Opening:**
   ```
   "Hey there! üèà I'm Jake, your new fantasy football copilot, and I am PUMPED to help you absolutely dominate your league this season!

   I've been analyzing fantasy football for years, and I've noticed that the most successful managers all have their own unique style. Some love diving deep into the data, others trust their gut on bold moves, and some just want efficient advice without spending hours researching.

   What's your vibe? Are you someone who likes to understand the 'why' behind every decision, or do you prefer quick, actionable advice? Or maybe something totally different?"
   ```

2. **Natural Style Discovery**
   - No forced archetype presentation
   - Conversational exploration of user preferences

   **Conversation Examples:**

   **If User Mentions Learning:**
   ```
   Jake: "I love that! There's nothing better than a manager who wants to actually understand the game. You're going to be dangerous once you start seeing the patterns I can show you.

   You sound like what I call an 'Eager Learner' - someone who doesn't just want to be told what to do, but wants to understand WHY it's the right move. That's honestly my favorite type of manager to work with because you'll actually get better over time instead of just following advice blindly.

   Does that sound like your approach?"
   ```

   **If User Mentions Data/Analysis:**
   ```
   Jake: "Oh man, a kindred spirit! I absolutely love working with managers who appreciate the numbers behind the game. You're probably the type who actually reads the advanced stats and doesn't just look at last week's points, right?

   You've got that 'Calculated Strategist' mindset - you want the data, the context, the matchup analysis, all of it. I can definitely work with that! I've got access to tons of advanced metrics and I love breaking down why certain plays make sense from a numbers perspective.

   Sound like I'm reading you right?"
   ```

3. **Confirmation Through Enthusiasm**
   - Celebrates user's style choice
   - Explains specific benefits for their archetype
   - Builds excitement for the partnership

4. **Natural Transition**
   - Seamless flow to next steps
   - Maintains conversational momentum

   AI: "When I explain strategies and decisions, what works best for you?

   3Ô∏è‚É£ **Go Big or Go Home** - I'm here for the high-risk, high-reward plays!
   
   Which describes your style?"
   ```

4. **Optional Question 3** (if defined by PM/PO)
   ```
   AI: "[Question about learning interests or specific fantasy focus areas]"
   ```

5. **Summary & Completion**
   ```
   AI: "Perfect! Let me make sure I've got this right:
   
   ‚úÖ You're an **Eager Learner** 
   ‚úÖ You prefer **[selected depth]** explanations
   ‚úÖ Your risk style is **[selected risk level]**
