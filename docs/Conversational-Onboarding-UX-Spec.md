# Roster Copilot Conversational Onboarding UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, conversation flows, visual design specifications, and interaction patterns for Roster Copilot's conversational onboarding system. The purpose is to transform the traditional form-based onboarding into an engaging, natural conversation that establishes the AI Copilot's personality while capturing essential user preferences.

- **Primary Design Focus:** Epic 2 - AI Copilot Onboarding & Personalization Foundation MVP
- **Key Stories:** Story 2.1 (Conversational Archetype Selection) & Story 2.2 (Conversational Questionnaire)
- **Technical Foundation:** Existing `PersistentChatInterface.tsx` component

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas
- **Primary:** New fantasy football users ("Eager Learners") seeking guidance and education
- **Secondary:** Experienced users wanting personalized AI assistance without lengthy setup
- **Tertiary:** Busy users preferring quick, intuitive interactions over complex forms

### Usability Goals
- **Conversational Ease:** Onboarding feels like chatting with a knowledgeable friend, not filling out forms
- **Quick Completion:** Entire flow completable in under 3 minutes (PRD requirement)
- **Clear Understanding:** Users understand the AI Copilot's purpose and their archetype selection
- **Seamless Integration:** Natural transition from onboarding to main app experience
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of unclear responses or user confusion

### Design Principles
1. **"Conversation Over Forms"** - Natural dialogue patterns replace traditional UI elements
2. **"Progressive Personality Reveal"** - AI Copilot's character emerges through conversation tone
3. **"Clarity Through Context"** - Information provided when needed, not all at once
4. **"Forgiving Interaction"** - Multiple ways to respond, easy error recovery
5. **"Consistent Voice"** - Maintain AI Copilot personality throughout conversation
