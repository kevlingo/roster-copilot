# Roster Copilot Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

**Goal:** The primary goal of Roster Copilot is to empower fantasy football players of all skill levels by providing a deeply personalized, AI-driven companion that simplifies strategic decision-making, enhances game understanding, and makes fantasy football more accessible and enjoyable.

**Objective (for MVP):** The Roster Copilot MVP aims to deliver a core set of AI-powered features, including a personalized onboarding experience, guided draft assistance, and intelligent in-season advice (waivers, start/sit decisions with matchup considerations), built upon a functional fantasy football platform. The objective is to clearly demonstrate the value of its unique AI Copilot in addressing common pain points for both new and experienced players, particularly reducing the learning curve and the cognitive load of complex decisions.

**Context:** Fantasy football is a popular and engaging activity, but current platforms often present a steep learning curve for newcomers and require significant time and analytical effort from all users to make optimal decisions. Existing tools provide data but lack truly adaptive, personalized guidance. Roster Copilot addresses this gap by introducing an intelligent AI Copilot designed to provide seamless, user-centric support, initially as a Proof-of-Concept for a hackathon entry with a one-month development timeline.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

**A. Standard Fantasy League Core Functionality (Baseline for MVP):**

* The system shall allow users to create and manage their accounts (e.g., sign-up, login, basic profile).
* The system shall enable users to create a new fantasy league with a minimal set of essential customization options (e.g., league name, number of teams, basic scoring rules like PPR or standard).
* The system shall allow users to join existing fantasy leagues.
* The system shall provide a live online draft room that supports a standard draft format (e.g., snake draft) with basic drafting tools (e.g., player queue, pick timer).
* The system shall allow users to manage their team rosters, including setting weekly lineups and processing add/drop player transactions through a basic waiver wire system.
* The system shall display fantasy scores for NFL games. *(For the PoC, this will utilize a static, representative dataset. The architecture should allow for future integration of live data feeds via a provider model).*
* The system shall provide access to basic player statistics and relevant NFL news. *(For the PoC, these will be drawn from static, representative datasets. The architecture should be designed to incorporate live data sources post-PoC via a provider model).*

**B. Roster Copilot AI-Powered Features (MVP Differentiators):**

* **AI Copilot Onboarding System (Conversational):**
    * The system shall engage users in a natural conversation through the AI chat interface to select from predefined "Fantasy Manager Archetypes" (e.g., "The Strategic Veteran," "The Bold Risk-Taker," "The Busy Optimizer," and **"Eager Learner"** (for users new to fantasy football or still learning)).
    * The archetype selection process shall be conversational, with the AI Copilot explaining each archetype and guiding users to make their selection through natural language interaction.
    * Upon selection, an initial User Preference Profile based on the chosen archetype will be established.
    * If the **"Eager Learner"** archetype is selected, the conversation shall seamlessly continue with a brief, guided questionnaire (2-3 key questions) presented in conversational format to capture essential baseline preferences.
    * For all users, the system will employ a "Learn-As-You-Go" mechanism: The AI Copilot will observe user actions and decisions within the app and, when patterns or deviations from the current profile are detected, will proactively ask the user for confirmation to update and refine their User Preference Profile.
    * The system shall store and continuously evolve the User Preference Profile. **The User Preference Profile (selected archetype and responses to initial questions) should be easily viewable by the user within their profile settings for transparency (PoC scope).** *(Full editing capabilities and detailed views of implicitly learned traits are Post-MVP considerations).*
* **"Draft Day Co-Pilot" (Revised):**
    * The system shall offer personalized player recommendations during a live draft, tailored by the User Preference Profile and evolving team needs. **AI recommendations shall be presented with easily accessible basic player context (e.g., team, position).**
    * The system shall provide simple, clear explanations and guidance on draft procedures and basic strategy, particularly for users identified as new to fantasy football.
    * **The UI must allow users to easily ignore suggestions and make their own pick. *(Consideration for PoC: A simple way to request an 'alternative suggestion' from the AI for the current pick if feasible).***
* **Personalized In-Season AI Guidance (Revised):**
    * The system shall generate a "Personalized Weekly Strategy Digest" (e.g., delivered once or twice per week at scheduled times). This digest will provide:
        * AI-identified top waiver wire targets tailored to the user's team needs and their User Preference Profile.
        * AI-recommended start/sit options for key lineup decisions, considering matchups and user preferences, with concise explanations.
        * Brief highlights of important strategic considerations or matchup advantages/disadvantages for the upcoming week.
    * The system shall allow users to make "on-demand" queries to the AI Copilot for more detailed analysis or advice on specific in-season decisions.
    * The system shall proactively issue "Critical Alerts" to the user for urgent, high-impact events. **Critical alerts for player injuries on the user's roster shall also include immediate, viable replacement suggestions from the user's current bench, if suitable options exist, in addition to potential waiver targets.**
    * The AI Copilot's internal analysis for both the digest and on-demand queries will be informed by data from any identified critical events.
* **Basic "Explain My Advice" Feature (Revised):**
    * For key AI-generated suggestions, the system shall present a clear rationale.
    * The style, depth, and focus of this rationale will be dynamically adapted based on the user's established "User Preference Profile."
    * Explanations will aim to be concise and clearly link the AI's advice back to relevant user preferences or simplified insights from its analysis. *(Consideration for future: Allow users to temporarily request a different level of explanation detail.)*

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

* **Performance:**
    * Key AI Copilot suggestions (e.g., during draft, critical alerts) shall be presented to the user within a few seconds (e.g., targeting 3-5 seconds) of the relevant trigger or user query to maintain engagement during time-sensitive moments.
    * General UI transitions and core application interactions shall feel smooth and responsive, without noticeable lag on typical modern web browsers.
    * The application user interface must be fully usable and responsive when accessed via a standard mobile web browser environment.
* **Usability:**
    * The overarching design principle for Roster Copilot shall be extreme ease of use, ensuring all features, especially AI Copilot interactions, are seamless and intuitive for both new and seasoned players.
    * A first-time user selecting the "Eager Learner" (or similar beginner-focused) archetype shall be able to complete the AI Copilot Onboarding flow (archetype selection and a few clarifying questions) in under 3 minutes and clearly understand its purpose.
    * Core AI-generated advice and its explanations must be presented in a manner that is easily understandable at a glance.
    * Navigation to essential fantasy management functions (e.g., viewing roster, setting lineup, accessing waiver claims) and AI Copilot insights shall be straightforward and require minimal effort.
* **Aesthetics & Visual Appeal:**
    * The application UI shall be modern, clean, and visually appealing, with a distinct quality that makes it "pop" and stand out.
    * The UI shall adhere to a consistent and professional design language.
    * The application must be responsive, ensuring a high-quality visual and interactive experience across common desktop and mobile web browser sizes.
* **Accessibility (Basic for PoC):**
    * Key textual content generated by the system, including all AI-generated advice and explanations, shall be designed to be screen-reader accessible.
    * Sufficient color contrast shall be utilized for primary UI elements and all text to ensure readability.
    * Core interactive elements within the application shall be navigable using a keyboard.
* **Reliability (for PoC Demo):**
    * The Roster Copilot application must demonstrate stability and remain functional throughout a typical hackathon demonstration scenario (e.g., 10-15 minutes) when showcasing the core MVP features. There should be no crashes or critical errors encountered within the primary demonstrated user flows.
* **Maintainability/Extensibility (Architectural Principle for PoC):**
    * The application's data access layer for fantasy scores, player statistics, and NFL news (which will use static/synthetic data for the PoC) shall be designed using a provider model. This architecture must allow for the future replacement of these static data sources with live data feeds with minimal refactoring of the core application logic.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

**Overall Vision & Experience:**
The Roster Copilot user experience must be modern, clean, intuitive, and visually engaging ("pop"). The primary goal is to make interacting with a sophisticated AI Copilot feel effortless, supportive, and even delightful. For newcomers, the experience should be welcoming, jargon-free where possible, and build confidence quickly. For experienced users, it should feel like a powerful, intelligent tool that respects their time and enhances their strategic capabilities. The application must be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile web.

**Key Interaction Paradigms & Design Goals:**

* **AI Copilot Integration:** The AI Copilot should feel like an integrated, ever-present companion, not a separate, bolted-on feature. Its advice and insights should be presented contextually and clearly.
    * *UI Concept Idea:* Engaging "Archetype Cards" for onboarding; an unobtrusive "Copilot's Corner" or "Insight Panel" for draft day advice that uses subtle cues to draw attention; interactive "Insight Cards" or a "Story" format for the Weekly Digest.
* **Simplicity & Clarity for Newcomers:** Prioritize clear navigation, straightforward language, and readily available explanations for core fantasy concepts and AI suggestions.
    * *UI Concept Idea:* The "Preference-Driven Explanation Style" should ensure explanations for newcomers are particularly gentle and informative, possibly using simpler layouts and friendly iconography.
* **Efficiency for All Users:** While providing deep insights, the interface should allow users to make quick decisions and manage their teams efficiently. Key information and AI suggestions should be easily scannable.
* **Visual "Pop" & Modern Aesthetic:** The UI design should be contemporary, utilizing a clean layout, high-quality visual elements (icons, possibly subtle animations where appropriate), and a professional color palette that inspires confidence and engagement.
* **Personalization Cues:** The UI should subtly reinforce that the experience is tailored.
    * *UI Concept Idea:* Visually differentiating AI explanation styles based on user profile/archetype.
* **Trust & Transparency:** Interactions should be designed to build trust in the AI Copilot's capabilities by making its reasoning accessible (via the "Explain My Advice" feature) and giving users control over final decisions.
* **Accessibility:** Core interactions and information presentation will adhere to the basic accessibility NFRs defined (screen-reader accessible text for AI advice, good color contrast, keyboard navigability for primary actions).

## Technical Assumptions

This information is primarily for the Architect to understand the foundational technical context for the Roster Copilot Proof-of-Concept:

* **Project Nature & Timeline:** This is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a hackathon entry, with a one-month development timeline for the MVP application.
* **Development Methodology:** Heavy reliance on AI assistance for rapid development is planned.
* **Data Sourcing for PoC:** Core NFL data (scores, player stats, news) will utilize static/synthetic datasets for the MVP to ensure rapid development. A provider model architecture is intended to allow for future integration of live data feeds.
* **Platform Focus for PoC:** A web-based application is the primary target for the MVP, ensuring broad accessibility for demonstration and rapid iteration.
* **Technology Leanings for PoC:** Technology choices should prioritize rapid development, strong support for AI/ML libraries, and ease of deployment for a PoC (e.g., Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express for backend; React, Vue, or Svelte for frontend).
* **Repository & Service Architecture for PoC:** Given the timeline and PoC nature, a simple structure is anticipated (e.g., a single repository containing a monolith web application or a clearly delineated frontend and backend within that monorepo). The primary goal is speed of development and demonstration of core AI features.

| :----------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context      | PASS     | Well-defined in the "Goal, Objective and Context" section. Captures the problem, user needs (especially for newcomers), and business objectives for the PoC.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition              | PASS     | "Functional Requirements (MVP)" clearly distinguishes core functionality from AI differentiators. The "Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP" section helps define scope boundaries. The hackathon context appropriately frames the MVP validation approach (demonstration of concept).                                                                       |
| 3. User Experience Requirements    | PASS     | The "User Interaction and Design Goals" section has been populated and captures the high-level UX vision, supporting NFRs for Usability and Aesthetics.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4. Functional Requirements           | PARTIAL  | The "Functional Requirements (MVP)" section is well-drafted. However, these are not yet broken down into formal User Stories with detailed Acceptance Criteria (e.g., "As a user...") within the "Epic Overview" section of the PRD. This detailed breakdown is a typical next step, but the current high-level story titles in "Epic Overview" are suitable for PoC planning. |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements       | PASS     | The "Non Functional Requirements (MVP)" section is comprehensive for a PoC, covering performance, usability, aesthetics, basic accessibility, reliability for demo, and maintainability (provider model for data).                                                                                                                                  |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure            | PASS     | The "Epic Overview" section now contains high-level Epic definitions with corresponding high-level user story titles/objectives, appropriate for PoC planning. "First Epic Completeness" (scaffolding, etc.) is more for architectural/dev planning, but the PoC implies a very lean first epic.                                                    |
| 7. Technical Guidance                | PASS     | Good initial guidance is present in the "Technical Assumptions" section (reflecting hackathon needs, PoC nature, static data) and will be further detailed in the "Initial Architect Prompt" section of the PRD.                                                                                                                                  |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements     | PARTIAL  | *Data Requirements:* Broadly understood (static data for PoC, AI needs player data), but not a dedicated detailed section. Sufficient for PoC. *Integration Requirements:* Minimal for PoC. *Operational Requirements:* PoC context implies minimal operational overhead beyond demo stability.                                                         |
| 9. Clarity & Communication           | PASS     | The PRD content drafted so far is clear, uses consistent language, and is well-structured. User involvement ensures stakeholder alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Critical Deficiencies / Recommendations for Next Steps (Post PM Checklist Assessment):**

* No critical deficiencies that block the understanding or usability of this PRD for a hackathon PoC.
* The "PARTIAL" ratings for "Functional Requirements" and "Cross-Functional Requirements" reflect the level of detail appropriate for this stage and for a PoC. Further detailing of User Stories with full ACs within the "Epic Overview" would be the next step for a full-scale project but is likely deferred for the hackathon's rapid development.
* The PRD is now considered sufficiently detailed to guide the development of the Roster Copilot Proof-of-Concept.
