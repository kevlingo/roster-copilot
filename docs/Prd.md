# Roster Copilot Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Empower fantasy football players of all skill levels with deeply personalized, AI-driven strategic guidance
- Reduce the learning curve for newcomers through intelligent, conversational onboarding and explanations
- Provide real-time draft assistance with personalized player recommendations and clear rationale
- Deliver intelligent in-season advice for waiver pickups and start/sit decisions with matchup considerations
- Demonstrate the unique value of an AI Copilot approach in addressing common fantasy football pain points
- Create a functional proof-of-concept that showcases AI-powered personalization within a one-month development timeline

### Background Context

Fantasy football is a popular and engaging activity, but current platforms often present a steep learning curve for newcomers and require significant time and analytical effort from all users to make optimal decisions. Existing tools provide extensive data but lack truly adaptive, personalized guidance that understands individual play styles, risk tolerances, and learning preferences.

Roster Copilot addresses this gap by introducing an intelligent AI Copilot designed to provide seamless, user-centric support. The AI Copilot learns user preferences through conversational onboarding, adapts its communication style to match user expertise levels, and provides contextual guidance throughout the fantasy football experience. This approach transforms fantasy football from a data-heavy analytical challenge into an accessible, enjoyable experience supported by intelligent assistance.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The Roster Copilot user experience must be modern, clean, intuitive, and visually engaging with a distinct "pop" quality. The primary goal is to make interacting with a sophisticated AI Copilot feel effortless, supportive, and delightful. For newcomers, the experience should be welcoming, jargon-free where possible, and build confidence quickly. For experienced users, it should feel like a powerful, intelligent tool that respects their time and enhances their strategic capabilities. The application must be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile web.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**AI Copilot Integration:** The AI Copilot should feel like an integrated, ever-present companion, not a separate, bolted-on feature. Its advice and insights should be presented contextually and clearly through engaging "Archetype Cards" for onboarding, an unobtrusive "Copilot's Corner" or "Insight Panel" for draft day advice, and interactive "Insight Cards" or "Story" format for the Weekly Digest.

**Simplicity & Clarity for Newcomers:** Prioritize clear navigation, straightforward language, and readily available explanations for core fantasy concepts and AI suggestions. The "Preference-Driven Explanation Style" ensures explanations for newcomers are particularly gentle and informative, using simpler layouts and friendly iconography.

**Efficiency for All Users:** While providing deep insights, the interface allows users to make quick decisions and manage their teams efficiently. Key information and AI suggestions are easily scannable with streamlined workflows.

**Personalization Cues:** The UI subtly reinforces that the experience is tailored through visually differentiating AI explanation styles based on user profile/archetype and personalized content presentation.

### Core Screens and Views

- **Onboarding Screen:** Conversational AI interface with archetype selection cards and progress indicators
- **Main Dashboard:** League overview with integrated AI Copilot panel showing personalized insights
- **Draft Room:** Live drafting interface with real-time AI recommendations and player context panels
- **Team Management:** Roster and lineup screens with AI-powered start/sit suggestions and waiver recommendations
- **Weekly Digest:** Personalized strategy overview with matchup analysis and action items
- **AI Copilot Profile:** User preference settings and archetype management interface

### Accessibility: WCAG

Core interactions and information presentation adhere to WCAG guidelines including screen-reader accessible text for AI advice, sufficient color contrast for readability, and keyboard navigability for primary actions.

### Branding

Modern, clean aesthetic utilizing contemporary design principles with high-quality visual elements, subtle animations where appropriate, and a professional color palette that inspires confidence and engagement while maintaining the distinctive "pop" quality that differentiates Roster Copilot.

### Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive - optimized for desktop and mobile web browsers with full functionality across all screen sizes and touch interfaces.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing integrated full-stack Next.js application to facilitate rapid development and deployment for hackathon timeline.
