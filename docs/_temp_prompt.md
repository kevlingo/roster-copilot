I need to conduct a comprehensive gap analysis between our updated user stories (enhanced with 2025 best practices) and our current implementation, then create systematic implementation sprints to update the site.

**Context:**
- We've completed systematic story enhancement with 2025 best practices for all 47 user stories
- All stories now have: modern technical guidance, current implementation references, focused testing strategies, and 2025 framework recommendations
- Current codebase may have outdated patterns, libraries, and implementations that need modernization

**Phase 2 Objectives:**
1. **Gap Analysis**: Review updated stories against current implementation to identify gaps
2. **Technical Debt Assessment**: Document outdated patterns and frameworks in current code
3. **Implementation Sprint Creation**: Create systematic sprints to update the site for each story
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Sequence implementation based on story dependencies and Epic order

**Recommended Agent: Architect (Fred)**
- Specializes in system architecture, technical design, implementation planning
- Perfect for analyzing current vs. target state and creating implementation roadmaps

**Deliverables Needed:**
1. **Gap Analysis Report**: Current implementation vs. updated story requirements
2. **Technical Debt Assessment**: Outdated patterns, libraries, frameworks to modernize
3. **Implementation Sprint Files**: Systematic sprints to update site for each Epic
4. **Dependency Map**: Implementation sequence based on story relationships

**Project Structure:**
- Repository: `roster-copilot` (Next.js, TypeScript, SQLite)
- Stories location: `docs/stories/` (47 total stories across 5 Epics)
- Enhanced stories have comprehensive 2025 best practices and testing guidance

**Next Steps:**
1. Load Architect persona and review current codebase structure
2. Analyze updated stories against current implementation
3. Create systematic implementation sprint files for modernization
4. Provide implementation roadmap with dependency sequencing

Please start by activating the Architect persona and beginning the gap analysis process.
