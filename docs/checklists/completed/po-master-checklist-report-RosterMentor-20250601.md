# Checklist Results Report: `po-master-checklist`

**Overall Assessment:** The Roster Copilot MVP plan, as detailed in the PRD, Architecture documents (System, Frontend, UI/UX Spec), and the formalized User Stories, is largely comprehensive and well-aligned. The sequencing of features and technical dependencies appears logical for a PoC.

**Category Statuses:**

| Category                                  | Status            | Critical Issues / Key Notes for Roster Copilot PoC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. PROJECT SETUP & INITIALIZATION** | **PASS** | Foundational elements for project setup and development environment are well-defined or implied by tech choices (Next.js) and detailed in `Architecture.md` and `Frontend-Architecture.md`. Initial stories cover data/API setup.                                                                      |
| **2. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT SEQ.** | **PASS** | Database (SQLite, seeding via Story 1.0.2), API (Next.js routes, middleware via Story 1.0.3), Deployment (Netlify, CI/CD from Git), and Testing Infrastructure (Jest/RTL, Playwright) are appropriately addressed for a PoC in `Architecture.md` and `Frontend-Architecture.md`.                     |
| **3. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS** | **PASS** | Key third-party services (Google Gemini AI, Resend) and their API key management are outlined in `Architecture.md`. External API contracts are conceptually defined. Infrastructure services primarily managed by Netlify.                                                                             |
| **4. USER/AGENT RESPONSIBILITY DELINEATION**| **PASS** | Standard delineation: user handles external account setup/credentials; AI (Developer) Agents handle code, config, automated tests. This is implicit in the BMAD approach.                                                                                                                             |
| **5. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES** | **PASS** | Functional dependencies (auth before protected features, core league before draft) and technical dependencies (data models before use, APIs before client) appear logically sequenced in the formalized stories across Epics 1-4. Cross-epic dependencies support incremental value.                   |
| **6. MVP SCOPE ALIGNMENT** | **PASS** | Core MVP goals from `Prd.md` are addressed by Epics 1-4 and their stories. User journeys for key AI features (Onboarding, Draft Co-Pilot, Weekly Digest, Alerts) are covered. Technical NFRs and constraints from `Prd.md` and `Architecture.md` are reflected.                                        |
| **7. RISK MANAGEMENT & PRACTICALITY** | **PARTIAL/PASS** | *Technical Risks*: Using a new AI (Gemini) has inherent unpredictability, but static data for PoC mitigates data risks. Performance NFR for AI is noted. *External Dependency Risks*: Minimal for PoC. *Timeline Practicality*: The 1-month hackathon timeline for the defined scope is ambitious but not a document deficiency per se. No explicit "prototyping stories" for Gemini, but AI feature stories will inherently involve this. |
| **8. DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF** | **PASS** | Developer-facing documentation (API refs, setup, architecture decisions, patterns) is being created through this process. User-facing documentation is minimal for PoC (UI text itself).                                                                                                            |
| **9. POST-MVP CONSIDERATIONS** | **PASS** | `Prd.md` includes "Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP." `Architecture.md` mentions a provider model for future data integration. `Frontend-Architecture.md` notes future considerations for i18n/feature flags. Feedback mechanisms are minimal/N_A for PoC.                                                    |

**Critical Deficiencies / Items Requiring Attention:**

* No critical deficiencies were found that block proceeding. The "PARTIAL/PASS" for Risk Management is more of an awareness point regarding the ambitious timeline and inherent nature of using cutting-edge AI for a hackathon.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Timeline Risk (Project Management):** While the documentation is sound, the project team should remain mindful of the ambitious scope for a 1-month hackathon and prioritize ruthlessly if time constraints become an issue during development.
2.  **AI Integration Prototyping (Implicit):** Ensure that early development stories involving Google Gemini AI integration (e.g., Story 3.1 for draft recommendations, Story 4.1 for digest) allow for some flexibility or rapid prototyping to understand its capabilities and quirks within the Roster Copilot context.

**Final Decision (based on this checklist):**

* **APPROVED**: The Roster Copilot MVP plan, as documented, is comprehensive, internally consistent, and appears ready for the next stage of detailed story preparation for development by the Scrum Master and Developer Agents.
