- Documented three new strategic documents:
  - AI-Powered Conversation Strategy
  - Conversational Onboarding UX Specification  
  - Architecture Update Summary
- Updated Stories section to highlight new AI-powered stories (2.5, 2.6, 2.7)
- Marked completed stories with status indicators

## Key Transformations Documented

### **From Keyword-Matching â†’ To AI Intelligence**

**Old Architecture Pattern:**
```
User Input â†’ Keyword Parser â†’ Static Script â†’ Response
```

**New Architecture Pattern:**
```
User Input â†’ Chat Interface â†’ Conversation Intelligence Engine â†’ 
Context Analysis â†’ Jake Personality System â†’ Gemini API â†’ 
Dynamic Response â†’ Conversation State Update â†’ User Experience
```

### **Enhanced Component Responsibilities**

**AI Copilot Service (Enhanced):**
- Jake personality system and conversation context management
- Dynamic conversation flow with personality adaptation
- Intelligent prompts for Gemini API Service
- Conversation memory and building capabilities
- Archetype discovery through natural conversation
- Adaptive questionnaire flow management

**New AI Service Components:**
- **Gemini Service:** Centralized API integration with rate limiting and optimization
- **Jake Personality System:** Consistent personality with fantasy football expertise
- **Conversation Intelligence Engine:** Context-aware conversation management

## Implementation Readiness

### **Sharded Documents Status:**
âœ… **API Reference** - Updated with Gemini API conversational intelligence  
âœ… **Project Structure** - Enhanced with new AI service components  
âœ… **Component View** - Updated architectural patterns and responsibilities  
âœ… **Frontend State Management** - Added AI conversation state patterns  
âœ… **Documentation Index** - Comprehensive catalog of new AI documents  

### **Story Implementation Support:**
âœ… **Story 2.5** - Gemini API foundation architecture documented  
âœ… **Story 2.6** - AI archetype discovery patterns documented  
âœ… **Story 2.7** - Enhanced questionnaire architecture documented  

### **Development Guidelines:**
- **Clear component structure** for AI services and conversation management
- **Defined TypeScript interfaces** for conversation state and API integration
- **Documented patterns** for personality adaptation and context management
- **Architecture diagrams** updated to reflect AI conversation flow

## Synchronization Status

### **Documents in Sync:**
âœ… **Main Architecture Document** - Source of truth for AI conversational intelligence  
âœ… **Frontend Architecture Document** - Source of truth for AI conversation patterns  
âœ… **Epic 2 Documentation** - Updated with new stories 2.5-2.7  
âœ… **Sharded Architecture Documents** - All granular documents updated  
âœ… **Documentation Index** - Complete catalog of all documents  

### **Cross-Reference Validation:**
- All sharded documents reference consistent AI service component names
- TypeScript interfaces align across frontend and backend documentation
- Conversation flow patterns consistent across all documents
- Jake personality system documented consistently across all references

## Strategic Impact

The updated sharded documentation provides:

### **Implementation Support:**
- **Granular component specifications** for AI service development
- **Clear interface definitions** for Gemini API integration
- **Consistent patterns** for conversation intelligence implementation
- **Comprehensive architecture** for Jake personality system

### **Development Efficiency:**
