## Overall UX Goals & Principles

* **Target User Personas:**
    * **The Eager Learner:** For users completely new to fantasy football or those still learning the ropes. They might feel overwhelmed by too much data or complex jargon. They value clear guidance, simple explanations, an intuitive interface, and features that help them learn the game and make confident decisions without a steep learning curve. Their goal is to feel competent, have fun, and steadily improve.
    * **The Calculated Strategist:** An experienced player who enjoys planning, analyzing, and optimizing their team for the long haul or for specific weekly advantages. They appreciate efficiency, access to relevant data, tools that offer a verifiable strategic edge, and personalized insights that respect their existing knowledge. They want control and robust information to inform their decisions.
    * **The Bold Playmaker:** Often an experienced player, but distinctly characterized by a willingness to take risks for big rewards and to make unconventional moves. They value features that help identify high-upside players, contrarian opportunities, or support for aggressive strategies. They want an AI Copilot that can intelligently support or provide a sounding board for their bold decisions.
* **Usability Goals:**
    1.  **Effortless Onboarding:** New users, particularly "The Eager Learner," can complete the initial AI Copilot onboarding and setup in under 3 minutes, feeling welcomed and understanding the immediate value.
    2.  **Intuitive Navigation & Operation:** All users can easily find core fantasy management functions and AI Copilot insights with minimal clicks and a clear understanding of how to operate the application.
    3.  **Clarity of AI Insights:** AI-generated advice, explanations, and data are presented in a way that is quickly understandable, relevant, and actionable for the user's specific persona and context.
    4.  **Seamless Decision Support:** The interface facilitates a smooth and efficient process for users to consider AI Copilot suggestions and make their fantasy management decisions.
    5.  **Confidence & Control:** Users feel empowered and in control, understanding that the AI Copilot is an assistant, and they can easily accept, reject, or explore alternatives to its suggestions.
    6.  **Accessible Learning Curve:** For "The Eager Learner," the UI and AI interactions should actively contribute to their understanding of fantasy football concepts and strategies.
* **Core Design Principles:**
    1.  **AI as an Empowering Copilot:** All AI interactions should be designed to feel like a supportive, intelligent partnership. The AI guides and empowers the user, helping them learn and make confident decisions, rather than just dictating actions.
    2.  **Clarity & Simplicity First:** Prioritize ease of understanding and intuitive navigation in all UI elements, information presentation, and feature interactions. Complexity should be managed by the AI, not exposed to the user, especially "The Eager Learner."
    3.  **Personalized & Contextual Experience:** The UI and AI responses must feel deeply tailored to the individual user (their archetype, learned preferences, and specific situation in the game). Every interaction should feel relevant.
    4.  **Modern, Engaging "Pop":** Deliver a visually appealing, clean, and responsive interface that feels fresh, enjoyable to use, and creates a distinct, positive brand impression.
    5.  **Build Trust Through Transparency & Control:** Ensure AI reasoning is accessible and understandable (via the "Explain My Advice" feature). Users must always feel in control of their decisions and understand how the AI is assisting them.

## Information Architecture (IA)

* **Site Map / Screen Inventory (MVP PoC):**
    * *Initial Setup & Onboarding:*
        1.  Sign-Up / Registration Screen
        2.  Login Screen
        3.  AI Copilot Onboarding Flow Screens (Archetype selection, brief questionnaire for "The Eager Learner")
        4.  User Profile Screen (View selected archetype/onboarding answers)
    * *League Entry & Core Hub:*
        5.  League Selection / "My Leagues" Dashboard (entry point to create/join)
        6.  League Home/Dashboard Screen (main hub per league, with digest summaries/alerts)
    * *Draft Phase:*
        7.  Live Draft Room Screen (incorporating AI Copilot Co-Pilot panel/area)
    * *In-Season Team & League Management:*
        8.  My Team / Roster Management Screen
        9.  Set Weekly Lineup Screen
        10. Waiver Wire / Add-Drop Players Screen (simplified for PoC)
        11. League Standings Screen (displaying static PoC data)
        12. Weekly Matchup Screen (displaying static PoC data)
        13. Player Information Screen/Modal (displaying static PoC data)
    * *AI Copilot Specific Interaction Points:*
        14. Dedicated "Weekly Strategy Digest Screen" (for full digest content)
        15. *AI Copilot Panel/Overlay:* (Persistent access point; content includes digest summaries, alerts, contextual prompts, links to full digest/other screens. Not a separate "screen" but a key IA element whose states/views need design).
* **Navigation Structure (MVP PoC):**
    * **Primary Navigation (e.g., persistent sidebar on desktop, icon-triggered overlay on mobile):**
        1.  **Dashboard / League Home:** Leads to *League Home/Dashboard Screen*.
        2.  **My Team:** Leads to *My Team / Roster Management Screen* (with access to "Set Weekly Lineup").
        3.  **Players:** Leads to *Waiver Wire / Add-Drop Players Screen* (and access to Player Information).
        4.  **League:** Leads to *League Standings Screen* and *Weekly Matchup Screen*.
        5.  **AI Copilot Hub / Digest:** Direct link to the full *Weekly Strategy Digest Screen* and perhaps "My Copilot Profile" view.
    * **Draft Room Access:** Prominently from the "League Home/Dashboard Screen" when a draft is active.
    * **User Account Access (e.g., top-right menu):** Links to "User Profile Screen," potentially "AI Copilot Onboarding Review," and "Logout."
    * **Contextual Navigation:** Crucial for linking AI suggestions (in panel/digest) directly to relevant action screens (e.g., lineup, waivers) with context.
* **Key Interaction Principles for AI Copilot Panel/Access Point:**
    * **Desktop Panel Behavior:** Defaults to open; user can collapse/hide; state is persisted across sessions; auto-reopens for critical alerts; visual cues for non-critical new info if collapsed.
    * **Mobile Access:** Via a clearly labeled icon triggering an overlay (e.g., bottom half of screen, allowing interaction with top half).
    * **Contextual Awareness & Verbosity:** Panel content/AI proactivity to be influenced by user's current screen and their archetype/profile (e.g., more guidance for "The Eager Learner").
    * **Unified Message Center:** Panel serves as a unified "chat history" style stream for messages, alerts, and digest summaries, with a clear history/dismiss option.
    * **Onboarding Integration:** The onboarding process will include a tour/introduction to the AI Copilot panel/icon and its functionality.

## Wireframes & Mockups
Visual designs (wireframes and mockups) for the key MVP screens (as defined in the User Flows and Information Architecture) will be developed using **Figma (free tier)**. Designs will focus on achieving the "modern, clean, engaging pop" aesthetic and will be linked here once created: {Placeholder for Figma Design File Link}.

## Component Library / Design System Reference
To achieve a modern look and feel rapidly for the hackathon PoC, the use of a readily available, high-quality open-source UI component library is recommended. Specific choice will depend on the frontend framework, but strong candidates include: **Tailwind CSS utility-first framework combined with a component system like Headless UI and/or DaisyUI** for flexible, modern styling. This choice must be well-documented.

## Branding & Style Guide Reference
Basic branding elements (logo if available, primary color scheme, and typography choices) will be defined during the UI design phase to support the "modern, clean, and engaging" aesthetic. For the PoC, these will be kept simple and impactful. {Placeholder for Link to Basic Style Guide/Brand Assets if created separately}.

## Accessibility (AX) Requirements
The Roster Copilot MVP UI will adhere to the following basic accessibility requirements, aiming to meet foundational aspects of WCAG 2.1 Level AA:
* All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable.
* Sufficient color contrast must be maintained for text and meaningful visual elements as per WCAG guidelines.
* Key textual content, especially AI-generated advice and explanations, must be programmatically accessible to screen readers (e.g., using appropriate HTML semantics and ARIA attributes where necessary).
* Forms will have clear, associated labels for all inputs.
* Focus indicators will be clearly visible for keyboard navigation.

## Responsiveness
The Roster Copilot MVP web application UI must be responsive and provide a good user experience on common screen sizes, including:
* Desktop/Laptop (e.g., typical widths from 1280px and up).
* Tablet (portrait and landscape - for PoC, ensuring usability).
* Mobile (portrait, e.g., typical widths from 360px to 480px).
Key layouts and the AI Copilot panel/overlay will adapt gracefully to these viewports.
